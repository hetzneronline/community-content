If you would like to make a contribution, please follow the instructions in the Contribution Guidelines and then open a Pull Request. One of the Community Managers will then evaluate your tutorial, and provide you with feedback.

**Important note:**

Unfortunately, there are currently not enough Community Managers to guarantee a timely review of your tutorials. We are already working on a solution and we apologize for any delays.
