<!-- This where the actual tutorial begins, with the title: -->

# Installing <software> on <Operating System>

## Introduction

The first paragraph or paragraphs are there for you to explain what your tutorial will do. Please don't simply list the steps you will be following, a table of contents (TOC) with the steps will be automatically added.
Make sure users know exactly what they will end up with if they follow your tutorial, and let them know if they need any specific prerequisites.
You can link to other tutorials that your tutorial builds on, and add recommendations for what users should know.

**Prerequisites**

If there are any prerequisites for your tutorial, please make sure there is already a tutorial explaining that, and then make sure to link to that other tutorial at the beginning of yours.

## Step 1 - <summary of step>

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.
Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial.
It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.
Feel free to include screenshots, to show exactly what the user should be seeing.
The amount of steps will depend entirely on how long/complicated the tutorial is.
