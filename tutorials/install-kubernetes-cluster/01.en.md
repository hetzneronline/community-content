## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the setup of a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster on Hetzner Cloud servers. The resulting cluster will support the full range of Kubernetes objects including [LoadBalancer service types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer), [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) and a private network between the servers. It will not cover high availability of the Kubernetes control plane.

**Prerequisites**

* A [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) account
* Familiarity with the [concepts of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)
* Familiarity with linux and working on the shell
* `ssh`, `hcloud`, `kubectl` and `helm` command line tools installed

*This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 Hetzner Cloud servers and Kubernetes version v1.15.3*

### Terminology and Notation

*Commands*

```bash
local$ <command>  # This command must be executed on your local machine
all$ <command>    # This command must be executed on all servers as root
master$ <command> # This command must be executed on the master server as root
worker$ <command> # This command must be executed on all worker servers as root
```

Multiline commands end with a backslash. E.g.

```bash
local$ command --short-option \
  --with-quite-long-parameter=9001
```

*IP Addresses*

* `<10.0.0.X>` internal IP address of server X
* `<116.203.0.X>` public IP address of server X
* `<159.69.0.1>` public floating IP address

---

*Explanations*

> This is a deeper explanation to the previous content. It might contain useful information, but if you did understand everything it can safely be skipped.

## Step 1 - Create new Hetzner Cloud resources

For this tutorial the following resources will be used

* 1 Hetzner cloud network
* 1 Hetzner cloud CX11 server
* 2 Hetzner cloud CX21 servers
* 1 IPv4 floating IP address
* 1 IPv6 floating IP address (optional)

The CX11 server will be the master node and the CX21 servers the worker nodes. The floating IP address(es) will be used for LoadBalancer services.

> While this guide will create the resources manually, a production setup should be set up with terraform, ansible or comparable tools. Have a look at the [Terraform Hcloud How-to](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-hcloud-terraform) or the [hcloud-k8s](https://github.com/gammpamm/hcloud-k8s) repository from [gammpamm](https://github.com/gammpamm) for examples and guidelines how to do so.

Create the required resources in the web interface or with the hcloud CLI tool

```bash
local$ hcloud network create --name kubernetes --ip-range 10.98.0.0/16
local$ hcloud network add-subnet kubernetes --network-zone eu-central --type server --ip-range 10.98.0.0/16
local$ hcloud server create --type cx11 --name master-1 --image ubuntu-18.04 --ssh-key <ssh_key_id> --network <network_id>
local$ hcloud server create --type cx21 --name worker-1 --image ubuntu-18.04 --ssh-key <ssh_key_id> --network <network_id>
local$ hcloud server create --type cx21 --name worker-2 --image ubuntu-18.04 --ssh-key <ssh_key_id> --network <network_id>
local$ hcloud floating-ip create --type ipv4 --home-location nbg1
local$ hcloud floating-ip create --type ipv6 --home-location nbg1  # (Optional)
```

> The existing ssh keys can be listed with `hcloud ssh-key list`. The network ID is printed when creating the network and can be looked up with `hcloud network list`.

The names of the server do not affect the cluster creation, but should not be changed later on. Feel free to change the image and type regarding your needs.

### Step 1.1 - Update the servers (Optional)

It is recommended to update the servers after creation. Log onto each server and run

```bash
all$ apt-get update
all$ apt-get dist-upgrade
all$ reboot
```

## Step 2 - Configure the network

Each server will have a private and a public IP address configured. Those are noted as `<10.0.0.X>` as private and `<116.203.0.X>` as public IP address.

### Step 2.1 - Configure floating IPs

For the LoadBalancer service type a floating IPs was registered in the first step. This IP address will be noted as `<159.69.0.1>`. For the setup to actually work, the IP address needs to be configured on all worker nodes. Create a file `/etc/network/interfaces.d/60-floating-ip.cfg`

```config
auto eth0:1
iface eth0:1 inet static
  address <159.69.0.1>
  netmask 32
```

If you also registered an IPv6 floating IP extend the config by

```config
iface eth0:1 inet6 static
  address <2001:db8:1234::1>
  netmask 64
```

Then restart your networking

```bash
worker$ systemctl restart networking.service
```

These IP addresses should not yet be assigned to a server, so don't worry that they can't be reached for now.

### Step 2.2 - Configure IPv6 to IPv4 translation (Optional)

If you have registered an IPv6 floating IP, the worker nodes need to be configured to translate IPv6 to IPv4, as Kubernetes currently does not support an IPv4/6 dual stack. This tutorial will (ab)use [gobetween](http://gobetween.io/) for the translation.

> Gobetween is a lightweight Layer 4 loadbalancer, that supports both TCP and UDP. Any other service which translates between IPv4 and IPv6 can be used instead as well.

To install gobetween download and extract the latest version from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yyyar/gobetween/releases) and place it in `/usr/local/bin/`. As of writing this guide, the current version is 0.7.0

```bash
worker$ cd /usr/local/bin
worker$ wget https://github.com/yyyar/gobetween/releases/download/0.7.0/gobetween_0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
worker$ tar -xvf gobetween_0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz gobetween
worker$ rm gobetween_0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Then create a small systemd unit file `/etc/systemd/system/gobetween.service`

```config
[Unit]
Description=Gobetween - modern LB for cloud era
Documentation=https://github.com/yyyar/gobetween/wiki
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=simple
PIDFile=/run/gobetween.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gobetween from-file /etc/gobetween.json -f json
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And a configuration file `/etc/gobetween.json`

```config
{
  "api": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "output": "stdout"
  },
  "servers": {
    "IPv6-tcp-http": {
      "bind": "[<2001:db8:1234::1>]:80",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "discovery": {
        "kind": "static",
        "static_list": [
          "<159.69.0.1>:80"
        ]
      }
    },
    "IPv6-tcp-https": {
      "bind": "[<2001:db8:1234::1>]:443",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "discovery": {
        "kind": "static",
        "static_list": [
          "<159.69.0.1>:443"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This config file should be adapted to match your needs. Check out the [gobetween documentation](http://gobetween.io/documentation.html) for further information.

> The basic idea is to listen on each used port and protocol on the IPv6 floating IP address and forward it to the IPv4 floating IP address.

When the configuration suits your needs you can reload the systemd unit files and start the gobetween service

```bash
worker$ systemctl daemon-reload
worker$ systemctl start gobetween.service
```

## Step 3 - Install Kubernetes

To install the Kubernetes cluster on the servers we will utilise [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/). The interface between Kubernetes and the Hetzner Cloud will be the [Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager) and the [Hetzner Cloud Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver). Both tools are provided by the Hetzner Cloud team.

### Step 3.1 - Prepare the Cloud Controller Manager

The [Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager) requires the Kubernetes cluster to be set up to use an external cloud provider. Therefor create a file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-hetzner-cloud.conf` on each server

```config
[Service]
Environment="KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--cloud-provider=external"
```

> This will make sure, that kubelet is started with the `cloud-provider = external` flag. Any further configuration will be handled by kubeadm later on.

### Step 3.2 - Install Docker and Kubernetes Packages

As Docker and Kubernetes are installed on a distribution with systemd as init system, Docker should be set up to use the systemd cgroups. To do so create a file `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/00-cgroup-systemd.conf` on each server

```config
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=systemd
```

If any further flags are required for Docker expand the ExecStart option accordingly. Then reload the systemd unit files on all servers to use the configured options

```bash
all$ systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then install the required packages by executing the following commands on all servers

```bash
all$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
all$ curl -fsSL https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
all$ cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker-and-kubernetes.list
        deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable
        deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
all$ apt-get update
all$ apt-get install docker-ce kubeadm kubectl kubelet
```

You need to make sure that the system can actually forward traffic between the nodes and pods. Set the following sysctl settings on each server

```bash
all$ cat <<EOF >>/etc/sysctl.conf

# Allow IP forwarding for kubernetes
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding = 1
EOF
all$ sysctl -p
```

> These settings will allow forwarding of IPv4 and IPv6 packages between multiple network interfaces. This is required because each container has its own virtual network interface.

### Step 3.3 - Setup control plane

The servers are now prepared to finally install the Kubernetes cluster. Log on to the master node and initialize the cluster

```bash
master$ kubeadm config images pull
master$ kubeadm init \
  --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 \
  --kubernetes-version=v1.15.3 \
  --ignore-preflight-errors=NumCPU \
  --apiserver-cert-extra-sans <10.0.0.1>
```

The `kubeadm init` process will print a `kubeadm join` command in between. You should copy that command for later use (not required as you can always create a new token when needed). The `--apiserver-cert-extra-sans` flag ensures your internal IP is recognized as valid IP for the apiserver.

> If the server has a flavor bigger than CX11, the `ignore-preflight-errors` flag does not need to be passed. You can add additional flags regarding your needs. Check the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/#options) for further information.

When the initialisation is complete begin with setting up the required master components in the cluster. For ease of use configure the kubeconfig of the root user to use the admin config of the Kubernetes cluster

```bash
master$ mkdir -p /root/.kube
master$ cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /root/.kube/config
```

The cloud controller manager and the container storage interface require two secrets in the `kube-system` namespace containing access tokens for the Hetzner Cloud API

```bash
master$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hcloud
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  token: "<hetzner_api_token>"
  network: "<hetzner_network_id>"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hcloud-csi
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  token: "<hetzner_api_token>"
EOF
```

Both services can use the same token, but if you want to be able to revoke them independent from each other, you need to create two tokens.

> To create a Hetzner Cloud API token log in to the web interface, and navigate to your project -> Access -> API tokens and create a new token. You will not be able to fetch the secret key again later on, so don't close the popup before you have copied the token.

Now deploy the Hetzner Cloud controller manager into the cluster

```bash
master$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager/master/deploy/v1.4.0-networks.yaml
```

And set up the cluster networking

```bash
master$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/a70459be0084506e4ec919aa1c114638878db11b/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

> This tutorial uses flannel, as the CNI has very low maintenance requirements. For other options and comparisons check the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/#pod-network)

As Kubernetes with the external cloud provider flag activated will add a taint to uninitialized nodes, the cluster critical pods need to be patched to tolerate these

```bash
master$ kubectl -n kube-system patch daemonset kube-flannel-ds-amd64 --type json -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/tolerations/-","value":{"key":"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized","value":"true","effect":"NoSchedule"}}]'
master$ kubectl -n kube-system patch deployment coredns --type json -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/tolerations/-","value":{"key":"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized","value":"true","effect":"NoSchedule"}}]'
```

> Taints are flags on a node, that only specific sets of pods are allowed to be scheduled on that node (which is defined by the pod tolerations). The controller-manager will add a `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint to each node which is not yet initialized by the controller-manager. But for the initialization to succeed the networking on the node and Cluster-DNS must be functional. Further information on taints and tolerations can be found in the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).

> If you just use a single node cluster, take care to taint the master node to accept pods: `kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-`

Last but not least deploy the Hetzner Cloud Container Storage Interface to the cluster

```bash
master$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/csi-api/release-1.14/pkg/crd/manifests/csidriver.yaml
master$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/csi-api/release-1.14/pkg/crd/manifests/csinodeinfo.yaml
master$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/master/deploy/kubernetes/hcloud-csi.yml
```

Your control plane is now ready to use. Fetch the kubeconfig from the master server to be able to use `kubectl` locally

```bash
local$ scp root@<116.203.0.1>:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ${HOME}/.kube/config
```

Or merge your existing kubeconfig with the `admin.conf` accordingly.

### Step 3.4 - Join worker nodes

In the `kubeadm init` process a join command for the worker nodes was printed. If you don't have that command noted anymore, a new one can be generated by running the following command on the master node

```bash
master$ kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

Then log on to each worker node and execute the join command

```bash
worker$ kubeadm join <116.203.0.1>:6443 --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

When the join was successful list all nodes

```bash
local$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
master-1   Ready    master   11m   v1.15.3
worker-1   Ready    <none>   5m    v1.15.3
worker-2   Ready    <none>   5m    v1.15.3
```

### Step 3.5 - Setup LoadBalancing (Optional)

Hetzner Cloud does not support LoadBalancer as a Service (yet). Thus [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) will be installed to make the LoadBalancer service type available in the cluster.

> A Kubernetes LoadBalancer is typically managed by the cloud controller, but it is not implemented in the hcloud cloud controller (because it's not supported by Hetzner Cloud). MetalLB is a project, which provides the LoadBalancer type for bare metal Kubernetes clusters. It announces changes of the IP address endpoint to neighbor-routers, but we will just make use of the LoadBalancer provision in the cluster.

If you have not initialized helm yet run the following commands

```bash
local$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
EOF
local$ helm init --service-account tiller --history-max 200
```

Now you can install MetalLB with helm

```bash
local$ kubectl create namespace metallb
local$ helm install --name metallb --namespace metallb stable/metallb
```

Then create the config for MetalLB

```bash
local$ cat <<EOF |kubectl apply -f-
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb
  name: metallb-config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - <159.69.0.1>/32
EOF
```

This will configure MetalLB to use the IPv4 floating IP as LoadBalancer IP. MetalLB can reuse IPs for multiple LoadBalancer services if some [conditions](https://metallb.universe.tf/usage/#ip-address-sharing) are met. This can be enabled by adding an annotation `metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip` to the service.

### Step 3.6 - Setup floating IP failover (Optional)

As the floating IP is bound to one server only I wrote a little controller, which will run in the cluster and reassign the floating IP to another server, if the currently assigned node becomes NotReady.

> If you do not ensure, that the floating IP is always associated to a node in status Ready your cluster will not be high available, as the traffic can be routed to a (potentially) broken node.

To deploy the [Hetzner Cloud floating IP controller](https://github.com/cbeneke/hcloud-fip-controller) create the following resources

```bash
local$ kubectl create namespace fip-controller
local$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbeneke/hcloud-fip-controller/master/deploy/rbac.yaml
local$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbeneke/hcloud-fip-controller/master/deploy/deployment.yaml
local$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fip-controller-config
  namespace: fip-controller
data:
  config.json: |
    {
      "hcloudFloatingIPs": [ "<116.203.0.1>" ],
      "nodeAddressType": "external"
    }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: fip-controller-secrets
  namespace: fip-controller
stringData:
  HCLOUD_API_TOKEN: <hetzner_api_token>
EOF
```

> If you did not set up the hcloud cloud controller, the external IP of the nodes might be announced as internal IP of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. In that event you must change `nodeAddressType` in the config to `internal` for the floating IP controller to work correctly.

Please be aware, that the project is still in development and the config might be changed drastically in the future. Refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cbeneke/hcloud-fip-controller) for config options etc.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you now got a fully featured Kubernetes cluster running on Hetzner Cloud servers. Now you should start to install your first applications on the cluster or look into [high availability for your control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/).
