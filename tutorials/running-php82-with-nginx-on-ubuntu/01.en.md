## Introduction
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
By default _Nginx_ is not capable of processing dynamic web pages with PHP so it requires the use of specific additional plugins for this purpose. One of these plugins is FPM (FastCGI Process Manager). FPM is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites. It is the preferred method of processing PHP pages with Nginx and is faster than traditional CGI based methods.

**Prerequisites**
 You will need a working [Nginx setup](https://github.com/hetzneronline/community-content/blob/master/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04/01.en.md) on your Ubuntu machine.

## Step 1 - Login to your server
Login to your Ubuntu server:
```
ssh holu@10.0.0.1
```

### Step 1.1 - Add PPA repository
At the time of writing this tutorial PHP 7.4 is the default PHP version in Ubuntu repositories. To install the latest version of PHP, we are going to use the _Ondrej PPA_ repositories. This repository contains multiple PHP versions and PHP extensions.
Once you are logged,  add the Ondrej PPA with the following command:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```
When prompted, press ENTER to proceed with adding the repository.

### Step 1.2 - Update system packages
With new repository added, we need to update system packages running the command:
```
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 1.3 - Install dependencies
Install required dependencies as shown below:
```
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates apt-transport-https software-properties-common
```

## Step 2 - Uninstall old PHP versions (optional)
If you already have a different version of PHP installed, we recommend to uninstall it:
```
sudo apt-get purge php7.*
```
The example command shows how to uninstall PHP7 and related packages. Adjust the version number to the one you have installed on your machine.

## Step 3 - Install PHP8.2-FPM
With the PPA enabled, you can now install PHP 8.2:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install php8.2-fpm
```
The above command will download and install all of the necessary dependencies.

### Step 3.1 - Check installation
Check the successful PHP installation with the command:
```
php -v
```
The output will show the installed version on your machine.

## Step 4 - Install PHP8.2 extensions
To list all loaded extensions run the following command:
```
php --modules
```
The command to install PHP 8.2 extensions is:
```
sudo apt install php8.2-<extension>
```
You just need to replace extension with the one you want to install, e.g., mysql, curl, gd, xml, etc... Extensions available by default are the listed below:
![php8.2 extensions](/images/php82_extensions.png)
## Step 5 - Enable PHP8.2 via Nginx configuration
Now that you have PHP-FPM installed, we need to enable it on Nginx. To do so, update Nginx configuration (use nano or any other editor):
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
Uncomment the fastcgi_pass line as shown below:
![NGINX with PHP 8.2-FPM configuration](/images/nginx_php82fpm.png)These lines should be already included in the Nginx configuration but commented by default.
Finally, don't forget to add the **index.php** to the indexes list:
![NGINX PHP indexes configuration](/images/nginx_php_index.png)
## Conclusion
We have successfully configured our Nginx server with PHP-FPM. Now we can host a website on it.
