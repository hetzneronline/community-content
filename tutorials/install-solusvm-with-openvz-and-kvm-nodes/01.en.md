## Introduction

In this tutorial I will show you how to install SolusVM with 2 nodes, 1 as master with OpenVZ virtualization and 1 as a slave with KVM virtualization.

**Prerequisites**
* 2 servers with root access 

## Step 1 - Order your servers

* Login to your account, for example at Hetzner from [Hetzner Accounts](https://accounts.hetzner.com)
* Choose the master servers you would like to use, for example from [Hetzner dedicated servers](https://hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver) and click `Order`
* Choose your server location - it's up to you
* From Operating System choose `Rescue System`
* From right sidebar click `Order Now`
* Now you will be redirected to ordering page
* From server login details if you'd like to access your server using SSH key then choose `Public key` and select your machine public key then click `Save`
* Now click the checkout button
* And finally check the agreement checkbox and then click `Order in obligation` button
* Now you should receive the order confirmation mail
* Repeat these steps for the slave server and wait until your servers are ready; you will get an email once the servers are ready

## Step 2 - Install CentOS using VNC

* Go to the server list in Robot, you will now see your 2 brand new server
* Click on the server you want to use as a `master node`
* Click `VNC` tab, choose your installation language and from `Distribution` choose `CentOS 6.10`
* Click on `Activate VNC installation`
* Now go to `Reset` tab and choose `Execute an automatic hardware reset`, then click `send`
* Wait some time until your server reboots and then open any `VNC Viewer` and login to your server using the provided credentials from the `VNC` tab
* You should now see a graphical user interface for the CentOS installation. Just follow the steps on screen
* And of course repeat these steps for the slave node

## Step 3 - Install SolusVM master

* After you finish installing the operating system on both servers, login to your master server using your root account like `ssh root@10.0.0.1`
* Update your package manager with `# yum update`
* Install `wget` and `nano` with `# yum install wget nano`
* Download `SolusVM` with the command `# wget https://files.soluslabs.com/install.sh`
* And install it with `# sh install.sh`
* Now it will ask you for installation type
	* For the master node type `2` to install `OpenVZ with basic templates` and hit `Enter`
* Wait until the installer finishes the installation process and you should now see `SolusVM UI Login Information`
* Now login to your server control panel from (https://10.0.0.1/admincp)
* First thing you would see now is the `License Page`, go to official SolusVM website and obtain a trail license from [SolusVM](https://www.soluslabs.com/clients/cart.php)
* Update your license and start installing the slave node

## Step 4 - Install SolusVM slave

* Login to your slave server using your root account like `ssh root@10.0.0.2`
* Update your package manager with `# yum update`
* Install `wget` and `nano` with `# yum install wget nano`
* Download `SolusVM` with the command `# wget https://files.soluslabs.com/install.sh`
* And install it with `# sh install.sh`
* Now it will ask you for installation type
 	* Select type `4` to install the `KVM` node and hit `Enter`
* Wait until the installer finishes the installation process; you should now see the node key `ID Key` and `ID Password`, keep them in an external text file to use later

## Step 5 - Configure network and setup bridge

* First you should backup your driver file 
	* `# cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0--backup`
* Now edit your network driver with `# nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` like this:
	``` 
      TYPE=Ethernet
      NAME=eth0
      UUID=<device-uuid>
      DEVICE=eth0
      ONBOOT=yes
      BRIDGE=br0
      HWADDR=<network-driver-mac-address>
    ```
* And add your bridge with `# nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0` like this:
	```
      TYPE=Bridge
      BOOTPROTO=none
      DEFROUTE=yes
      IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
      IPV6INIT=no
      IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
      IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
      IPV6_PEERDNS=yes
      IPV6_PEERROUTES=yes
      IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
      NAME=bridge0
      DEVICE=br0
      ONBOOT=yes
      IPADDR=10.0.0.2
      PREFIX=23
      GATEWAY=<network-gateway>
      DNS1=8.8.8.8
      DNS2=8.8.4.4
      IPV6_PRIVACY=no
      IPV6_PEERDNS=yes
      IPV6_PEERROUTES=yes
      HWADDR=<network-driver-mac-address>
    ```

* Restart your network `# service network restart`

## Step 6 - Add the slave node to master

* Back to master server control panel, from nodes go to `add node`
* Fill your nodes data like this:
	* Node Name  : whatever you want `e.g. kvm01`
	* Type 		 : `KVM`
	* IP Address : `10.0.0.2`
	* Hostname 	 : `<your_host>` e.g. `kvm-01.example.com`
	* SSH Port 	 : `22`
	* ID Key	 : `<your-slave-node-id-key>`
	* ID Password: `<your-slave-node-id-password>`
	* Country 	 : `your country`
	* City 		 : `your city`
	* LV Group 	 : `your node lv-group` you can know it from executing `# vgdisplay` on slave node
* Click `Add Node`

## Step 7 - Add IP Blocks to the node

* Go to `IP Blocks` from your master node control panel and click `Add IPv4 Block`
* Fill the form inputs like this:
	* Block Name : `whatever you want`
	* Gateway    : `you can know it from Hetzner Robot in the IP tab`
	* Netmask    : `you can also know it from Hetzner Robot`
	* Nameserver1: `8.8.8.8` Google DNS 1
	* Nameserver2: `8.8.4.4` Google DNS 2
	* choose the node that this block belongs to
* After adding the `IP Block` go to Hetzner Robot and order IPs for each node (as many as you need). Please note that Hetzner allows you to order maximum 6 single IPs, so if you need more then you have to order a subnet
* You will receive an email shortly confirming your order
* Now go to the `IP Block` which you've created and add the IPs to it
* Repeat these steps for the slave node and we are done

## Conclusion

We have learned how to install CentOS from a VNC interface, setup LVM group on multiple drives, install SolusVM on fresh servers as a master and slave with both OpenVZ and KVM virtualization, setup network bridge and add IPs to the server to use it.
