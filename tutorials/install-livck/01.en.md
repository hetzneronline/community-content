## Introduction

This article is about the installation of the self-hosted monitoring software **[LIVCK](https://livck.com)**, which is completely set up and ready for use within 10 minutes.

**Prerequisites**

The prerequisite for this installation is to have a cloud server that runs on **Ubuntu 20.04** or newer.

I recommend the Hetzner cloud server **CX21**, which offers sufficient performance, the **location** of the server is up to you. In the tutorial, we will use **Falkenstein** as location.

The default credentials of the software:

* Username: `admin` (or admin@example.com)
* Password: `livvck`

## Step 1 - Update & Upgrade

The very first thing we do is update the package lists and packages on the server so that we are up to date.

```shell
apt update && apt upgrade
```

## Step 2 - Install Dependencies

Now we install the necessary dependencies for the software, including Php, Nginx & Supervisor

```shell
apt -y install php7.4 php7.4-{cli,gd,mysql,pdo,mbstring,tokenizer,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip} wget unzip nginx supervisor curl
```

### Step 2.1 - Install Composer

Now we install the Package-Manager **Composer**, which allows the software to obtain more of its necessary packages

```shell
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

## Step 3 - Install LIVCK

We will now create a folder where the software will eventually reside

```shell
mkdir -p /var/www/livck
```

### Step 3.1 - Download files from LIVCK

You can find your license on the [LIVCK](https://livck.com/manage/licenses) page under your profile, copy it and paste it in the URL (Replace it with REPLACE).

Before you can start the download, you have to enter the IP of the server into the [IP Whitelist](https://livck.com/manage/whitelist) of LIVCK. You can find the IP in the HCloud panel, but it is enough to whitelist the IPv4.

```shell
cd /var/www/livck && wget -4 https://livck.com/dl/self-hosted/REPLACE -O livck.zip
```

### Step 3.2 - Unpack LIVCK files

```shell
unzip livck.zip
```

### Step 3.3 - Move LIVCK files to correct folder

```shell
mv LIVCK-self-hosted-*/* . && cp LIVCK-self-hosted-*/.env.example .env
```

### Step 3.4 - Delete useless files

```shell
rm LIVCK-self-hosted-* -R && rm livck.zip
```

### Step 3.5 - Configure Application

For LIVCK a database like MySQL is needed, for this you can already find a tutorial [here](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-mysql-database-server-on-ubuntu).

**Create a database and a user (or use the root), which we can specify in the application**

```shell
nano .env
```

You will now see this in the editor similar to the one shown below, there you can customize the name (APP_NAME) & under DB_DATABASE will be the database name you created as well as user and a password.

Finally you only have to set your license key under LICENSE_KEY and the configuration would be done.

```ini
APP_NAME=LIVCK
APP_URL=http://your-domain.com

LICENSE_KEY="XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=livck
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD="password"
```

## Step 4 - Configure LIVCK

Now we install the required packages for the software.

```shell
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --ignore-platform-reqs && chmod -R gu+w storage/ && chmod -R guo+w storage/ && chmod -R gu+w bootstrap/cache/ && chmod -R guo+w bootstrap/cache/
```

### Step 4.1 - Configure Supervisor

Now we configure the queue with supervisor.

```shell
nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/livck.conf
```

**Add the following content to the file and save it**

```
[program:livck-queue-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/livck/artisan queue:work --queue=default,newsletter --timeout=60 --tries=255
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=root
numprocs=1
redirect_stderr=true
```

Now restart the supervisor service

```shell
service supervisor restart
```

### Step 4.2 - Configure Crontab

Now we run the software backend on crontab.

```shell
{ crontab -l; echo "* * * * * php /var/www/livck/artisan schedule:run >/dev/null 2>&1"; } | crontab -
```

The return of the command is **no crontab for root** and is good!

### Step 4.3 - Configure Nginx

Now we configure nginx (webserver).

```shell
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/livck
```

**Edit the content you see below, there replace DOMAIN-NAME to your domain and save it**

If your domain is not yet connected to the server, we would recommend you to set an A record in your DNS.

Name: status (or one of your choice)
Target: Your Server IP

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/livck/public;

    index index.php;
    server_name DOMAIN-NAME;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Now restart the nginx service

```shell
service nginx restart
```

### Step 4.4 - Configure SSL (Optional Step)

Now we configure nginx (webserver).

```shell
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

**Replace the status.your-domain.de and mail to yours**

```shell
certbot --nginx --agree-tos -m acme@your-mail.de --domain status.your-domain.de
```

**Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access - To Secure your traffic, choose number 2!**

### Step 4.5 - Migrate Database

Now we can migrate all tables

```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force
```

### Step 4.6 - Storage Availability

Now we can publish the storage

```shell
php artisan storage:link
```

## Conclusion

The software is now fully functional, and you can start adding your services to monitor them.
