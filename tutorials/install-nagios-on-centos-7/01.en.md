## Introduction

Nagios (now known as Nagios Core) is a free and open source computer-software application that monitors systems, networks and infrastructure. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. It alerts users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved.

**Prerequisites**

To install Nagios on your server, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

This guide is based on SELinux being disabled or in permissive mode. To disable SELinux use the below command:

```bash
sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0
```

## Step 1 - Install Required Dependencies

We need to install Apache, PHP and some libraries like gcc, glibc, glibc-common and GD libraries and its development libraries before installing Nagios with source. To do so, we can use the default package installer yum.

First, install the required packages:

```bash
yum install -y httpd httpd-tools php gcc glibc glibc-common gd gd-devel make net-snmp openssl-devel xinetd unzip
```

## Step 2 - Create Nagios User and Group

We must create a user and group that will run the Nagios process. Create a **nagios** user and **nagcmd** group with these commands:

```bash
useradd nagios
groupadd nagcmd
```

Then add both the **nagios** user and the **apache** user to the **nagcmd** group.

Then add the user to the group with these commands:

```bash
usermod -G nagcmd nagios
usermod -G nagcmd apache
```

## Step 3 - Download Nagios Core and Nagios Plugin

Download the latest Nagios Core 4.4.3 and Nagios plugins 2.2.1 packages. Go to the [Nagios downloads page](https://www.nagios.org/download/core-stay-informed), copy the link address for the latest stable release so you can download it to your Nagios server.

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.4.3.tar.gz
wget https://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
```

Extract the Nagios Core and Plugins archive with this command:

```bash
tar xvf nagios-4.4.3.tar.gz
tar xvf nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
```

## Step 4 - Configure Nagios Core

Now we will configure Nagios Core. To do so, we need to go to the Nagios directory and run the configure file. If everything goes fine, it will show the output in the end as sample output. Please see below:

```bash
cd nagios-4.4.3
./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd
```

Sample output:

```bash
Creating sample config files in sample-config/ ...


*** Configuration summary for nagios 4.4.3 2019-01-15 ***:

 General Options:
 -------------------------
        Nagios executable:  nagios
        Nagios user/group:  nagios,nagios
       Command user/group:  nagios,nagcmd
             Event Broker:  yes
        Install ${prefix}:  /usr/local/nagios
    Install ${includedir}:  /usr/local/nagios/include/nagios
                Lock file:  /run/nagios.lock
   Check result directory:  /usr/local/nagios/var/spool/checkresults
           Init directory:  /lib/systemd/system
  Apache conf.d directory:  /etc/httpd/conf.d
             Mail program:  /bin/mail
                  Host OS:  linux-gnu
          IOBroker Method:  epoll

 Web Interface Options:
 ------------------------
                 HTML URL:  http://localhost/nagios/
                  CGI URL:  http://localhost/nagios/cgi-bin/
 Traceroute (used by WAP):


Review the options above for accuracy.  If they look okay,
type 'make all' to compile the main program and CGIs.
```

Now compile Nagios with this command:

```bash
make all
```

Now we can run these **make** commands to install Nagios, init scripts, and sample configuration files:

```bash
make install
make install-init
make install-commandmode
make install-config
make install-webconf
```

## Step 5 - Customize Nagios Configuration

Open the "contacts.cfg" file with your choice of editor and set the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact to receive email alerts.

```bash
vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
```

Sample Output:

```bash
###############################################################################
#
# CONTACTS
#
###############################################################################

# Just one contact defined by default - the Nagios admin (that's you)
# This contact definition inherits a lot of default values from the
# 'generic-contact' template which is defined elsewhere.

define contact {

    contact_name            nagiosadmin             ; Short name of user
    use                     generic-contact         ; Inherit default values from generic-contact template (defined above)
    alias                   Nagios Admin            ; Full name of user
    email                   admin@example.com       ; <<***** CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS ******
}
```

## Step 6 - Configure Web Interface

Use htpasswd to create an admin user, called "nagiosadmin", that can access the Nagios web interface:

```bash
htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

Enter a password at the prompt. Remember this login, as you will need it to access the Nagios web interface.

Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.

```bash
systemctl start httpd.service
```

## Step 7 - Compile and Install Nagios Plugins

```
cd /tmp
cd nagios-plugins-2.2.1
./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
make
make install
```

## Step 8 - Verify Nagios Configuration Files

Verify the Nagios configuration file using the following command:

```bash
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```

Sample Output:

```bash
Nagios Core 4.4.3

```

## Step 9 - Add Nagios Services to System Startup

To make Nagios work across reboots, we need to add nagios and httpd with chkconfig and systemctl command.

```bash
systemctl enable nagios
systemctl enable httpd
```

Restart Nagios to make the new settings take effect.

```bash
systemctl restart nagios.service
```

## Step 10 - Access Nagios Web Interface

Open your web browser, and go to your Nagios server:

```bash
http://nagios_server_public_ip/nagios
```

Because we configured Apache to use htpasswd, you must enter the login credentials that you created earlier. We used **nagiosadmin** as the username.

## Conclusion

Finally, you have successfully installed and configured Nagios core service in your server.
