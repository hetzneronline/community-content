## Introduction

The pfSense instance on hcloud will have a static public ip assigned, however a residential connection will likely change its IP address once a day. Hence IPSec very much prefers static endpoints we can "bypass" this requirement by utilizing a dynamic dns
service to keep track of our non-static public ip. There are many free and paied providers, I personally can reccomend [ddnss.de](https://ddnss.de/) as its a German company and their free service is sufficient for the requirements.

Please select a service that suits your needs, create a account and follow the providers tutorial on how to configure it with your router.

**Prerequisites**

* hcloud machine with pfSense installed (iso is available for booting)
* Dynamic DNS service

## Step 1 - Setup FritzBox with DDNS

AVM allows to select a custom (ger.: "Benutzerdefiniert") DDNS provider. This utilizes a string replacement method to custom build the string. Wether or not this is a usefull function is up for debate but has to be kept in mind.

For DDNSS.de use the following configuration:

```bash
DynDNS-Provider: Custom
Update-URL: https://www.ddnss.de/upd.php?user=<username>&pwd=<pass>&host=<domain>
Domainname: ENTER YOUR DOMAIN HERE (i.e. yoursubdomain.ddnss.de)
Username: YOUR USERNAME
Password: YOUR Password
```

## Step 2- Setup IPSec configuration on pfSense

Navigate to the admin interface of your pfSense instance, log in and goto `VPN -> IPSec -> Add P1`.

AVM does not provide very secure configuration options but they should be sufficient for personal information.

The configuration has to be set to these settings:

```bash
Key exchange version:   IKEv1
Internet protocol:      IPv4
Interface:              WAN
Remote Gateway:         yourdomain.ddnss.de

=== Phase 1 Proposal (Authentication) ===
Authentication Method:  Mutual PSK
Negotiation mode:       Aggressive
My identifier:          My IP address
Peer identifier:        Distinguished name      yourdomain.ddnss.de
Pre shared key:         CLICK ON Generate

=== Phase 1 Proposal (Encryption Algorithm) ===
Algorithm:              AES
Key lenght:             256 bits
Hash:                   SHA512
DH Group:               2 (1024 bit)
Lifetime (Seconds):     28800
```

The rest can be left as is.

Next the Phase 2 has to be configured for actual network connection.

Click on `Show Phase 2 Entries (0)`, then `Add P2` and configure the second phase as follows:

```bash
Mode:                   tunnel
Local network:          [10.0.1.0 /24]      *1
NAT/BINAT translation:  None
Remote network:         [192.168.178.0 /24] *2

=== Phase 2 Proposal (SA/Key Exchange) ===
Protocol:               ESP
Encryption Algorithms:  AES     256 bits
                        !!REST UNCHECKED!!
Hash Algorithms:        SHA512
PFS key group:          2 (1024 bit)
Lifetime:               3600                        
```

Save and click `Apply changes ✔`

*NOTES:*

`*1` This is the private IP of your hcloud internal network. Please reffer to this [excelent tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/how-to-route-cloudserver-over-private-network-using-pfsense-and-hcnetworks).

`*2` This is the private network of your FritzBox usually this defaults to `192.168.178.0/24` if you changed this you have to change this accordingly.


### pfSense Firewall considerations

In order to secure the publicly available pfSense instance there are several good stepts to be taken.

1. Only allow access to management interfaces (WebUi, ssh, ...) via tunnel or access only via hcloud console.
1. Install snort, and enable on WAN interface in blocking mode.
1. Do not allow any ingress on WAN. IPSec is automatically detected and sorted via the IPSec chain.

For further hardening please reffer to to this [thred over @ netgate](https://forum.netgate.com/topic/113685/hardening-securing-and-privacy-configuration/7)

## Step 3 - Connect FritzBox to pfSense

Open the FritzBox Admin UI and navigate to `Internet -> Freigaben (engl.: "Shares") -> VPN` and choose `VPN-Verbindung hinzufügen (engl.: "Add VPN connection")`. Select `Ihr Heimnetz mit einem anderen FRITZ!Box-Netzwerk verbinden (LAN-LAN-Kopplung)` and continue.

Configure the VPN as follows:

```bash
VPN-Kennwort (Preshared Key):       [THE PASSWORD CHOSEN IN Phase 1 Proposal]
Name der VPN-Verbindung:            Chose whatever
Internet-Adresse:                   Enter the public IP of the pfSense device
Entferntes Netzwerk:                10.0.1.0
Subnetzmaske:                       255.255.255.0
VPN-Verbindung dauerhaft halten:    Check    
```

## Conclusion

Please note that the FritzBox only pushes the defined network (10.0.1.0) onto its internal routing tables. In order to map multiple cloud subnets over the pfSense instance on your private network you have to manually add IPv4 routes.

To do so goto `Heimnetz -> Netzwerk -> Netzwerkeinstellungen -> Statische Routingtabelle -> IPv4 Routen -> Neue IPv4 Route` and add the additional hcloud subnet e.g. 10.0.2.0/24 like this:

```bash
IPv4-Netzwerk:      10.0.2.0
Subnetzmaske:       255.255.255.0
Gateway:            10.0.1.1 <- IP of pfSense instance
```
