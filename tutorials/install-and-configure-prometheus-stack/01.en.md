## Introduction

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a cloud-native metrics and monitoring solution. It can get metrics of any type of software like web servers, system usage or networking equipment.

This tutorial covers the basic steps to query the performance data of a server and show it in a dashboard using Grafana.

**Prerequisites**

* 2 Debian 10 servers
* Allow port 9100 in the [iptables firewall](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/iptables) or the cloud firewall for incoming traffic (INPUT chain) on the monitored node
* Allow port 3000 in the [iptables firewall](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/iptables) or the cloud firewall for incoming traffic (INPUT chain) on the monitoring server

**Test Setup**

```conf
2001:db8::1 node1.example.com
2001:db8::2 prometheus.example.com
```

## Step 1 - Install Node Exporter on target node

The Prometheus stack consists of multiple components. The metrics storage is prometheus itself, which scrapes metrics in periodic intervals from http endpoints. These endpoints can be provided by any software. You can find a list of exporters and integration [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/).

For this tutorial, we will use `node_exporter` to get basic system metrics such as cpu usage, network throughput or disk IO metrics. The following commands install and configure the target (monitored node).

```shell
apt update
apt install prometheus-node-exporter
```

The following commands are used to start and enable the node_exporter daemon for starting automatically after a reboot.

```shell
systemctl enable prometheus-node-exporter.service
systemctl start prometheus-node-exporter.service
```

Now, the http endpoint of the exporter should listen at tcp port 9100. Any http client like curl is able to collect the metrics:

```shell
root@node1.example.com:~# curl [2001:db8::1]:9100/metrics

# HELP apt_upgrades_pending Apt package pending updates by origin.
# TYPE apt_upgrades_pending gauge
apt_upgrades_pending{arch="amd64",origin="Debian-Security:10/stable"} 8
# HELP node_filesystem_size_bytes Filesystem size in bytes.
# TYPE node_filesystem_size_bytes gauge
node_filesystem_size_bytes{device="/dev/sda1",fstype="ext4",mountpoint="/"} 1.9970912256e+10
node_filesystem_size_bytes{device="/dev/sda15",fstype="vfat",mountpoint="/boot/efi"} 1.2594176e+08
# HELP node_forks_total Total number of forks.
# TYPE node_forks_total counter
node_forks_total 90780
# HELP node_intr_total Total number of interrupts serviced.
# TYPE node_intr_total counter
node_intr_total 1.6144664e+07
# HELP node_load1 1m load average.
# TYPE node_load1 gauge
node_load1 0.09
# HELP node_arp_entries ARP entries by device
# TYPE node_arp_entries gauge
node_arp_entries{device="eth0"} 3
```

## Step 2 - Install Prometheus server on collector node

The prometheus server is used to collect the exposed metrics of node_exporter into a time series database called OpenTSDB. It can be installed as a single file deployment as follows.

```shell
apt update
apt install prometheus jq
```

The Prometheus server must be configured to know the node_exporter metrics endpoint address and the scrape interval.
```# vim /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml```

```yaml
---
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'node1.example.com:9100'
```

Finally, start Prometheus and enable it to start automatically on reboot.

```shell
systemctl start prometheus.service
systemctl enable prometheus.service
```

```systemctl status prometheus``` confirms the successful launch of the service.

To view the status of monitoring targets, you can execute the following command. The output should look as follows:

```shell
root@prometheus.example.com:~# curl [::1]:9090/api/v1/targets 2>/dev/null| jq -r '.data.activeTargets[]|.scrapeUrl,.health,.lastError'
http://node1.example.com:9100/metrics
up
```

## Step 3 - Setup Grafana dashboard server

Now that the prometheus server is collecting frequently metrics from our node, the data is stored for 15 days. There are multiple ways to display the metrics. The widely used way is to setup Grafana which is a dashboard server for multiple data sources.

Enable the Grafana repository and install Grafana with the following commands:

```shell
apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

apt update
apt install grafana
```

Finally, enable and start the Grafana server daemon:

```shell
systemctl start grafana-server.service
systemctl enable grafana-server.service
```

## Step 4 - Configure Grafana data source and dashboard

The Grafana server provides a web interface. Please be careful to use only credentials for testing while the connection between your browser and the dashboard server is not secure.

You can access the interface by browsing to

```url
http://prometheus.example.com:3000/
```

The default credentials are as follows:

* Username: **admin**
* Password: **admin**

After login, you are asked to change this password.
In this state, there is no data source or dashboard configured. First, add a data source.

![Data source Menu](images/datasource_menu.png)

Select type ```Prometheus``` and type ```http://localhost:9090``` into the URL field.
After that, click ```Save & test``` to create the data source.

There are two ways to create dashboards. You can create every panel individually or import predefined dashboards from the community.
For displaying node_exporter metrics, a good dashboard can be found [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860).

Copy the ID to import the dashboard into your Grafana server.

![Dashboard Menu](images/dashboard_menu.png)

Press the **import** button, insert the copied ID and click **load**.
You need to select the Prometheus data source for the dashboard:

![Dashboard Import Menu](images/dashboard_import.png)

Finally, the Dashboard is imported and displays data of the monitored node.

## Conclusion

You now have configured a Prometheus stack and can monitor a single node. This setup has the capability of monitoring more nodes/services.
Please consider to apply a reverse proxy in front of the Grafana frontend as described [in this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-secure-nginx-lets-encrypt-debian-10).
