## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect a Hetzner Storage Box to your Windows system. The Storage Box provides reliable and scalable storage solutions and can be easily mounted on Windows using common network file protocols. This guide assumes you have an active Hetzner Storage Box account and basic familiarity with Windows settings.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. **Hetzner Storage Box credentials:**
   - Username: `u123456` (example)
   - Password: Your Storage Box password
2. **Storage Box hostname:** For example, `u123456.your-storagebox.de`
3. **Windows PC** running Windows 10 or later.
4. **Network File Protocols enabled:** Ensure your system supports SMB or WebDAV. Most Windows systems support SMB by default.

## Step 1 - Enable SMB Client on Windows
1. Open the **Control Panel**.
2. Navigate to **Programs** > **Programs and Features** > **Turn Windows features on or off**.
3. Scroll down and ensure **SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support** is checked.
   - If it is not checked, enable it and click **OK**.
4. Restart your computer if prompted.

## Step 2 - Open Network Drive Wizard
1. Press `Win + E` to open File Explorer.
2. Right-click on **This PC** and select **Map network drive**.

## Step 3 - Enter Storage Box Details
1. In the **Drive** dropdown, choose a letter (e.g., `Z:`).
2. In the **Folder** field, enter the Storage Box address in the format:
   ```
   \\<storagebox_hostname>\<your_folder>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   \\u123456.your-storagebox.de\backup
   ```
3. Check **Reconnect at sign-in** if you want the connection to persist after a restart.
4. Click **Connect using different credentials**.

## Step 4 - Authenticate
1. When prompted for credentials, enter your Hetzner Storage Box username and password.
   - Username: `u123456`
   - Password: Your Storage Box password
2. Click **OK**.

## Step 5 - Verify Connection
1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to **This PC**.
2. You should see the mapped drive listed under **Network Locations**.
3. Double-click the drive to ensure it opens and displays your Storage Box contents.

### Optional: Connecting via WebDAV
If SMB is unavailable or you prefer WebDAV:

1. Open **This PC** in File Explorer.
2. Right-click and select **Map network drive**.
3. Enter the WebDAV address for your Storage Box:
   ```
   https://u123456.your-storagebox.de
   ```
4. Follow the same steps for authentication as described above.

## Optional: Connecting via Command Prompt
For users who prefer using the command line:

1. Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator.
2. Use the following command to map the network drive:
   ```
   net use <drive_letter>: \\<storagebox_hostname>\<your_folder> /user:<username> <password>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   net use Z: \\u123456.your-storagebox.de\backup /user:u123456 your_password
   ```
3. Press **Enter**. If successful, you will see a message confirming that the command completed successfully.
4. Open **File Explorer** to verify that the drive is mapped under **This PC**.

## Conclusion
You have successfully connected your Hetzner Storage Box to your Windows PC. This setup allows you to access and manage your Storage Box like a local drive. For additional features or troubleshooting, refer to Hetznerâ€™s official documentation or contact their support team.
