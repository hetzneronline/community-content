## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to run a Debian system on a Managed Server with PRoot. PRoot is a rootless implementation of chroot.
To download and install Debian in a subdirectory we need to run debootstrap. By default debootstrap can't run without root permissions,
but we can use fakechroot and fakeroot to manipulate this behaviour.

**Prerequisites**

- [Managed Server](https://www.hetzner.com/managed-server?country=ot) with enabled SSH access
- Hetzner Development Package (hos-dev) -> please ask the support

## Step 1 - Install fakechroot

We need to download and compile the source.

Before we start, create a directory for the sources to keep the home directory clean.

```bash
cd
mkdir src
cd src
```

Download and compile the fakechroot sources.

- Always check [here](https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot) for newer stable versions

```bash
wget https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot/releases/download/2.20.1/fakechroot-2.20.1.tar.gz
cd fakechroot-2.20.1
./configure --prefix=/usr/home/holu/fakechroot
make -j $(($(grep ^cpu\ cores /proc/cpuinfo | uniq | sed s/[^0-9]//g)+1))
make install
cd
```

## Step 2 - Build the system with debootstrap

Run debootstrap with fakechroot and fakeroot to download and install the system in the subdirectory `debian-root`.

```bash
./fakechroot/bin/fakechroot fakeroot /usr/sbin/debootstrap --variant=fakechroot --arch amd64 bullseye debian-root https://deb.debian.org/debian
```
Remove unnecessary symlinks after installation.

```bash
rm debian-root/{dev,proc}
```

## Step 3 - Use PRoot to start a shell in the new system

### Step 3.1 - Download PRoot

Download PRoot and set the permissions.

```bash
wget https://proot.gitlab.io/proot/bin/proot
chmod 744 proot
```

### Step 3.2 - Start the shell

PRoot into `debian-root`, bind required diectories from the host system and start a root shell in the guest system.

```bash
PROOT_TMP_DIR="/usr/home/holu/.tmp" ./proot -0 -r debian-root -b /dev -b /proc -b /sys -b /usr/home/holu:/mnt/realhome -b /usr/www/users/holu:/mnt/realhome/public_html -w /root /usr/bin/env -i USER=root HOME=/root PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin TERM=$TERM LANG=C.UTF-8 /bin/bash -l
```

**Good to know:**

- Your real home would be mounted in `/mnt/realhome` with the above command
- You can only use ports > 1024 for services
- If your `proot` process gets killed, please ask the support for a process release
- Other processes inside of the PRoot maybe also need a process release
- You can use `/bin/bash -l -c "<command>"` to run a command without interactive shell

## Step 4 - Prepare the system

### Step 4.1 - Build the sources.list

Add the apt repositories to the `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

```bash
echo "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb https://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src https://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-backports main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src https://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-backports main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

### Step 4.2 - Fix users and groups

Before running apt on this system, we need to check for some often missing users and groups and create them if necessary.

```bash
getent passwd _apt || echo '_apt:x:100:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin' >> /etc/passwd
getent passwd systemd-timesync || echo 'systemd-timesync:x:101:101:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin' >> /etc/passwd
getent shadow _apt || echo '_apt:*:19026:0:99999:7:::' >> /etc/shadow
getent shadow systemd-timesync || echo 'systemd-timesync:*:19026:0:99999:7:::' >> /etc/shadow
getent group systemd-timesync || echo 'systemd-timesync:x:101:' >> /etc/group
getent group input || echo 'input:x:102:' >> /etc/group
getent group kvm || echo 'kvm:x:103:' >> /etc/group
getent group render || echo 'render:x:104:' >> /etc/group
getent group crontab || echo 'crontab:x:105:' >> /etc/group
getent group netdev || echo 'netdev:x:106:' >> /etc/group
getent gshadow systemd-timesync || echo 'systemd-timesync:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
getent gshadow input || echo 'input:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
getent gshadow kvm || echo 'kvm:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
getent gshadow render || echo 'render:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
getent gshadow crontab || echo 'crontab:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
getent gshadow netdev || echo 'netdev:!::' >> /etc/gshadow
```

### Step 4.3 - Update the system for the first time

```bash
apt update
apt upgrade
```

## Conclusion

Now you know a solution how to run a Debian guest system on a Managed Server inside of PRoot. Because you are root on this system, you can use it to install software and run tasks that require root access. Please also understand that some software can be inexcuteable or faulty, because you are still in a restricted environment. Please visit the website of the developer for further information.
