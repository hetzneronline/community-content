## What is Joomla?

Joomla is a powerful and versatile Content Management System (CMS).  
It is ideal for creating websites, blogs, online portals, or intranets – all without deep programming knowledge.  
<br/> More information: https://www.joomla.org


## Step 1: Download Joomla

You can get Joomla onto your webspace in two ways:

**Option 1** – Via SSH connection  
    For this option, at least Webhosting L is required.

- Download ZIP file  
        After establishing an SSH connection, the ZIP file can be downloaded directly into the public_html folder.

        joomlagg@<wwwXXX>:~/public_html$ wget https://downloads.joomla.org/de/latest

- Unzip ZIP file  
        Once the Joomla_<version>-Full_Package.zip file has been downloaded, you can unzip it.

        joomlagg@<wwwXXX>:~/public_html$ unzip Joomla_<version>_Stable-Full_Package.zip

- After extraction, all Joomla files should be located in the public_html folder.

---

**Option 2** – Via FTP

1. Download the ZIP file to your PC  
- Visit: https://downloads.joomla.org/de/latest  
- Choose the appropriate package and click "Download Now"  

2. Unzip the file  
- On Windows: Right-click → "Extract All"  
- On Linux/macOS: Unzip via file manager or terminal  

3. Upload files  
- Transfer the content of the extracted folder via FTP (e.g., with FileZilla) into the public_html directory on your server.

2.4 Configure database connection  
- Enter your MySQL database connection details

2.5 Authorize installation  
- For security reasons, Joomla requires you to delete a specific file from the installation/ folder. The file has a random name such as remove_me_abc123.txt.

**You have two options:**

- Via SSH:  
    
        joomlagg@<wwwXXX>:~/public_html$ cd installation/
        joomlagg@<wwwXXX>:~/public_html/installation$ rm <file-name>.txt

- Via FTP:  
Right-click the file in the installation/ folder → Delete

## Step 3: Complete installation
- Once the file has been deleted, click on “Install Joomla!”  
- Finally, you will see the message:  

**Congratulations – Joomla has been successfully installed!**
