## Introduction

In this tutorial you will setup your own mail server running on an Ubuntu Server in the Hetzner Cloud.
With Mailcow you can host your own mail server with your custom domain. Mailcow also provides a way to sync your Contacts and Calender.

Official documentation: [https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/)

**Prerequisites**

* You need a domain name
* A bit of knowledge of how Docker works
* Hetzner Cloud servers **by default blocks port 25 and 465** to protect from spammers. You can get these unblocked after your first invoice was paid. This basically acts as a simple verification, that you are not a spammer.

## Step 1 - Create a new Cloud server

* Login to your cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Create new project and name it whatever you want
* Choose your server location it's up to you
* Click `Add Server` and select your server image. This tutorial is based around `Ubuntu 20.04` but can easily be adapted to `Debian 11`, which is more stable and lighter
* Choose the resources you need from Type
* Click on the field `User Data` enter this `#include https://get.docker.com` (this will install docker)
* Select your SSH-Key
    * You can read [this article](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to learn how to generate an SSH key
* Write your server hostname in `name` input (mail.example.com)
* Click `Create & Buy Now`

## Step 2 - Setup DNS

Basically you want to create a new DNS record called mail.example.com and add your server IPv4 (A record) and IPv6 (AAAA record) to it.
Then you can setup your domains MX record to point to your mail.example.com subdomain that you just created.
You also need to setup an autodiscover.example.com and autoconfig.example.com subdomain, both should be of the type CNAME and point to mail.example.com

Your DNS configuration should look similar to this:

```
# Name              Type       Value
mail                IN A       10.0.0.1
mail                IN AAAA    2001:db8:1234::1
autodiscover        IN CNAME   mail
autoconfig          IN CNAME   mail

@                   IN MX 10   mail
```

## Step 3 - Install updates and Docker Compose on the server

Wait a few seconds for the server to startup and then connect to it using SSH and your private key.
Now you should install available updates on your server by running:

`apt update && apt upgrade -y`

Now you need to install Docker compose you can do this by running:

```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest" | awk -F '"' '/tag_name/{print $4}')/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

This command asks the GitHub API for the latest version of docker and than downloads the corresponding file.

Make Docker-Compose executable using chmod:

`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

## Step 4 - Clone the Mailcow Repository

Now we are going to clone the Mailcow GitHub repository, so first you need to `cd` to `/opt` with:

`cd /opt`

once your are in /opt you can run:

`git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized`

## Step 5 - Create the config, Pull the Docker containers and start Mailcow

To create the config, change your working directory to `/opt/mailcow-dockerized` with `cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized` and run `./generate_config.sh` this will generate the config. Now you have to enter your domain name (something like mail.example.com)

We are nearly done. Now you have to run `docker-compose pull` to pull the docker images.

In order to start Mailcow run `docker-compose up -d`

## Step 6 - Setup a reverse DNS entry

Go to the Hetzner Cloud console and click on your project, select the server you just created and go to the `networking` tab, and there select the three dots near your IPv4, and then select `Edit Reverse DNS`, then enter your domain (mail.example.com). The same needs to be done for your IPv6 address, simply type `::1` into the field where the IP is and then again enter your domain name (mail.example.com).

## Step 7 - Login and change your password

Now you can open mail.example.com in your browser and login using the default login:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `moohoo`

Do not forget to change your password. A length of 16 characters or more effectively counts as very secure, if no predictable patterns are used.

## Step 8 - Add your domain to Mailcow

Now you can add your domain to Mailcow, simply go to `Configuration` -> `Mail setup`. Add your domain under the tab Domain.

## Step 9 - Setup DKIM

Now when you go back to `Configuration` -> `Configuration & Details` you can setup DKIM. In the `Configuration` tap select DKIM in the sidebar. It should be at the top, scroll down till you see the mask where you can enter your domain. Simply click `Select domains with missing keys` shortcut to have your domain name filled in. Now select a `2048` key and click on `Add`. Once the key is added you can copy the public key and create a DNS TXT entry called `dkim._domainkey` with the content you just copied.

## Step 10 - Create a mailbox

When you go back to `Configuration` -> `Mail setup` you can create a mailbox and log into SOGo by accessing it under https://mail.example.com/SOGo

## Step 11 - Update Mailcow

Of course a mail server needs care and you should update it from time to time. Updating Mailcow is super easy, simply run: `./update.sh` and carefully follow the instructions.
