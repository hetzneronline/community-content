## Introduction

In this tutorial you will setup your own Mailserver running on an Ubuntu Server in the Hetzner Cloud.  
With Mailcow you can host your own Mailserver with your custom domain. Mailcow also provides a way to sync your Contacts and Calender.

**Prerequisites**

* You need a domain name
* A bit of knowledge of how Docker works

## Step 1 - Create a new Cloud server

* Login to your cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Create new project and name it whatever you want
* Choose your server location it's up to you
* Click `Add Server` and select `Ubuntu 18.04` from Image
* Choose the resources you need from Type
* Click on the field `User Data` enter this `#include https://get.docker.com` (this will install docker)
* Select your SSH-Key
    * You can read [this](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article to know how to generate SSH key
* Write your server hostname in `name` input (mail.example.com)
* Click `Create & Buy Now`

## Step 2 - Setup DNS

Basically you want to create a new DNS record called mail.example.com and add your server IPv4 (A record) and IPv6 (AAAA record) to it.  
Then you can setup your domains MX record to point to your mail.example.com subdomain that you just created.  
You also need to setup an autodiscover.example.com and autoconfig.example.com subdomain, both should be of the type CNAME and point to mail.example.com  

Your DNS configuration should look like this:

```
# Name              Type       Value
mail                IN A       10.0.0.1
mail                IN AAAA    2001:db8:1234::1
autodiscover        IN CNAME   mail
autoconfig          IN CNAME   mail

@                   IN MX 10   mail
```

## Step 3 - Install updates on the server (Optional)

Wait a few seconds for the server to startup and then connect to it using SSH and your private key.
Now you should install available updates on your server by running:  

`apt update && apt upgrade -y`  

## Step 4 - Install Docker Compose

Now you need to install Docker compose you can do this by running:  

```curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest" | awk -F '"' '/tag_name/{print $4}')/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose```  

`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`  

## Step 5 - Clone the Mailcow Repository

Now we are going to clone the Mailcow GitHub repository, so first you need to `cd` to `/opt` with:  

`cd /opt`  
once your are in /opt you can run:  
`git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized`  

## Step 6 - Creating the config

Change directory to `/opt/mailcow-dockerized` with `cd /opt/mailcow-dockerized` and run `./generate_config.sh` this will generate the config. Now you have to enter your domain name (something like mail.example.com)

## Step 7 - Pull the Docker containers

We are nearly done. Now you have to run `docker-compose pull` to pull the docker images.

## Step 8 - Start Mailcow

In order to start Mailcow run `docker-compose up -d`

## Step 9 - Setup a reverse DNS entry

Go to the Hetzner Cloud console and click on your project, select the server you just created and go to the `networking` tab, and there select the three dots near your IPv4, and then select `Edit Reverse DNS`, then enter your domain (mail.example.com). The same needs to be done for your IPv6 address, simply type `::1` into the field where the IP is and then again enter your domain name (mail.example.com).

## Step 10 - Login and change your password

Now you can open mail.example.com in your browser and login using the default login  
username: `admin`  
password: `moohoo`  

Please change your password :)

## Step 11 - Add your domain to Mailcow

Now you can add your domain to Mailcow, simply go to `Configuration` -> `Mail setup`. Add your domain under the tap Domain.

## Step 12 - Setup DKIM

Now when you go back to `Configuration` -> `Configuration & Details` you can setup DKIM. In the `Configuration` tap select DKIM in the sidebar. It should be at the top, scroll down till you see the mask where you can enter your domain. Simply click `Select domains with missing keys` shortcut to have your domain name filled in. Now select a `2048` key and click on `Add`. Once the key is added you can copy the public key and create a DNS TXT entry called `dkim._domainkey` with the content you just copied.

## Step 13 - Create a mailbox

When you go back to `Configuration` -> `Mail setup` you can create a mailbox and log into SOGo by accessing it under https://mail.example.com/SOGo

## Step 14 - Update Mailcow

Of course a mail server needs care and you should update it from time to time. Updating Mailcow is super easy simply run `./update.sh` and follow the instructions :)
