## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to install the Pterodactyl Panel with an unofficial installation script. Currently, there is no way to uninstall this completely without wiping your server, but an uninstall script is currently being worked on and will be finished in the near future.

**Disclaimer: I do not own this script, nor do I take resposibility for any damage done to your system. Taking a backup is recommended.**

**Disclaimer 2: This script is subject to change in the future. I will try and update this tutorial as often as I can**

Example terminology that you can use in the tutorial:

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

## Step 1 - Installing the panel

SSH into your server and make sure you are logged in as root. If you aren't, type `sudo su` and enter your root password. Then, run the script with the following command:
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://pterodactyl-installer.se)
```

### Step 1.1 - Choosing your installation option

You should see something that looks like this:

![Installation Choices](images/installchoice.jpg)

Unless you specifically want a different option, choose 3 (or whatever the equivalent is of installing the panel and wings on the same machine, as it may change)

### Step 1.2 - Configuring your MySQL database

Next, you will see the Database configuration screen that looks like this:

![Database Configuration menu](images/database.jpg)

By pressing return and leaving the field empty, you accept the default values shown in parentheses. I would highly recommend you set your own more memorable password instead of leaving it as auto-generated.

You will also be given other options such as the timezone and the email address. The timezone option uses the [PHP Timezones](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php) (e.g. for GMT, it would be `Europe/London` or for EST it would be `America/New_York`. Check the website linked for more information.). The email address is used for setting up an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt. If you aren't planning on using SSL, put your real email address in there anyway, just in case.

### Step 1.3 - Initial account setup

Next, it will ask you for the details of the initial admin account that you will use to login to the website. I would recommend the username to be admin, but you can set everything else to whatever you want. The email address doesn't have to be real unless you enable sending emails to customers in the panel.

### Step 1.4 - FQDN, Let's Encrypt and UFW

Next, you will be asked for an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). If you want to use a domain name, go to your DNS provider and add an A record for your domain and point it to your server's IP address. Make sure to do this before you enter the FQDN in the script. If you are using Cloudflare, make sure it isn't proxied otherwise you will have issues. If you just want to use an IP address, enter the IP of your server. Then, it will ask you if you want to use SSL. This **will not** work if you are using an IP address; make sure to say no whenever something mentioning SSL comes up (including Assume SSL).

It will then ask you if you want it to automatically configure UFW. Say yes, unless you want to do it yourself. The ports you need to allow are: `22`, `80`, `8080`, `443` and `2022`. After this, you should be good to go. It will give you a summary of the options you chose, and then it will ask you if you want to continue the intallation. Say yes. Now, sit back, and wait for the panel to install. This usually takes between 5 and 10 minutes. If it asks you about running Composer as root, just press enter.

Once it is finished, visit your FQDN and the panel should be online. Don't do anything on it yet though, we still need to install Wings.

## Step 2 - Installing Wings

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - <Summary of Step>

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - <Summary of Step> (Optional)

More instructions.

## Step N - <Summary of Step>

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
