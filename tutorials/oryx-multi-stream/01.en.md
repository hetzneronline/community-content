## Introduction

This detailed tutorial will guide you step-by-step through installing [Oryx](https://github.com/ossrs/oryx) on an Ubuntu server using Docker. With Oryx, you can restream your live broadcast to multiple platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch, or your own self-hosted solution (like restreamer.io), all at once. You'll also learn how to access Oryx's dashboard, securely configure access credentials, and understand Oryx's persistent storage directories.

If you want more technical details, refer to the [Oryx GitHub README](https://github.com/ossrs/oryx/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) or the [official Oryx documentation](https://ossrs.io/lts/en-us/docs/v6/doc/getting-started-oryx).

**Prerequisites**

- A fresh Ubuntu server (virtual or dedicated).
- Your streaming keys for all platforms you want to link (YouTube, Twitch, etc.).
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands and streaming concepts.
- Root/sudo access.

## Step 1 - Prepare Your Server (Update, Upgrade, Firewall)

Start by connecting to your server via SSH.

Update package lists and upgrade packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

(Optional) Set up a simple firewall to allow Oryx ports:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 2022/tcp
sudo ufw allow 2443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 1935/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8000/udp
sudo ufw allow 10080/udp
```
Enable firewall (if not enabled):
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 2 - Install Docker

We’ll use Docker, so let’s install it. For the latest options, see the [official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

Run these commands to install Docker quickly:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Check Docker is installed:
```bash
docker --version
```

For more details and troubleshooting tips, visit [Docker's Ubuntu installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Step 3 - Run Oryx Container

Before starting, choose a persistent data directory. We'll use `$HOME/data`, but you can use any path you prefer.

Launch Oryx using Docker:
```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/oryx:5
```
**China users:** Use the registry mirror:
```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ossrs/oryx:5
```

> **Note:** Oryx’s ports must be open in any firewall or security group.

**Port overview:**
- `2022` (HTTP, dashboard access, or use `80`)
- `2443` (HTTPS, or use `443`)
- `1935` (RTMP ingest)
- `8000` (WebRTC data)
- `10080` (SRT streaming)

## Step 4 - Access Oryx Web Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://<your_host>:2022
```
Replace `<your_host>` with your server's IP address.

You should see the Oryx web dashboard login page.  
**If you don't see it:**  
- Check your Docker logs (`docker logs oryx`)
- Double-check port forwarding/firewall rules

## Step 5 - First-Time Setup: Set Passwords

Upon first access, you will be prompted to set up or change your password (or it will be displayed on the login screen).

- The password and other dashboard settings are stored in the `.env` file located inside your data directory:  
  ```
  $HOME/data/config/.env
  ```
- You can directly edit this file and restart Oryx, or use the web interface to change the password.

**Important:**  
Choose a secure password and keep it safe—this controls streaming and admin access.

## Step 6 - Add Images & Manage Storage

To add images (for overlays, thumbnails, etc.), place them inside your Oryx data directory under a dedicated images folder:
```
$HOME/data/images/
```
You can reference or access these images via the dashboard as needed.

**Data Directory Structure**  

For a full explanation, see the [Oryx GitHub README](https://github.com/ossrs/oryx/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).  
By default, Oryx uses `/data` (mapped from host), which has subfolders for:

| Directory      | Purpose                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| /data          | Global Oryx data, config, all files       |
| config         | Configuration, password, SSL, settings    |
| dvr            | DVR storage (video recordings)            |
| record         | Saved stream recordings                   |
| images         | Your custom images (thumbnails/overlays)  |
| redis          | Redis DB for publish secrets & config     |
| signals        | Stream event logs                         |
| upload         | Uploaded files                            |
| vlive          | Virtual live event storage                |
| transcript     | Transcriptions (if enabled)               |
| nginx-cache    | Web proxy cache                           |
| srs-s3-bucket  | (Optional) AWS S3/Minio storage           |

You may choose to mount different host directories for each of these—for advanced options see the [detailed docs](https://ossrs.io/lts/en-us/docs/v6/doc/getting-started-oryx).

## Step 7 - Setup Streaming Destinations (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)

1. Log in to the Oryx dashboard.
2. Go to **Forwarder** /**Restream** section.
3. Click “Add” and enter the RTMP URL and Stream Key for each destination:
   - **YouTube:** `rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/[your-key]`
   - **Twitch:** `rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/[your-key]`
   - Add any other platforms (Facebook, custom RTMP, etc.).

You can add as many destinations as you like!

## Step 8 - Start Streaming

Use your preferred streaming software (OBS, ffmpeg, vMix) to stream to your Oryx server's RTMP endpoint:
```
rtmp://<your_host>/live
```
Set the stream key (as configured in Oryx dashboard).

Your stream will be forwarded to all configured platforms automatically.

## Step 9 - Advanced Configuration (Optional)

Explore further options:
- Enable HTTPS for the dashboard.
- Automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt (`.well-known` and `lego` folders).
- DVR and recording settings.
- Transcoding parameters or use SRT/WebRTC input/output.
