## Introduction

Ansible Molecule is a powerful testing framework that simplifies the process of testing Ansible roles in different scenarios. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up and using Ansible Molecule to test your Ansible roles effectively.

**Why use Molecule to test Ansible?**

Below are the reasons why you should consider using Molecule:
* **Automated Testing**: Molecule automates the testing process for Ansible roles, allowing you to define and execute test scenarios easily. This automation helps catch issues early in the development cycle, ensuring that roles behave as expected.
* **Isolation of Environments**: Molecule uses different drivers (e.g., Docker, Vagrant) to create isolated environments for testing. This ensures that tests are consistent and reproducible across different systems, reducing the likelihood of environment-related issues.
* **Multiple Testing Scenarios**: Molecule supports the definition of multiple scenarios, allowing you to test roles under various conditions. For example, you can test different operating systems, Ansible versions, or configurations to ensure role compatibility.
* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Molecule is designed to work seamlessly with CI systems like Travis CI, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. This enables you to automate the testing process every time changes are pushed to your version control system, ensuring continuous quality assurance.
* **Role Development Support**: Molecule includes tools for role development, such as role initialization, linting, and dependency management. This streamlines the development workflow and helps maintain a consistent codebase.
* **Parallel Execution**: Molecule supports parallel execution of tests, allowing you to save time when testing multiple scenarios simultaneously. This is crucial for speeding up the feedback loop during development.
* **Documentation and Best Practices**: Molecule encourages best practices in role development and testing. The tool's documentation provides clear guidance on structuring roles, writing effective test cases, and following recommended conventions.
* **Community Adoption**: Molecule is widely adopted within the Ansible community. Many Ansible roles and projects use Molecule for testing, making it a well-supported and reliable choice for role developers.

**Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the demo, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place. For CI workloads, `docker` is highly recommended without the need of `virtualenv`.
* **python**: Ansible is built on top of Python. Hence, it is the first first prerequisite. One could install python either with OS package manager or by compiling from sources. python3 is highly recommended.
* **pip**: Pip is the package manager of Python. We install molecule with pip as it is not yet available as an OS rpm.
* **ansible**: We need ansible to be installed. Just like python this could be installed either with OS package manager or from pip. 
* **molecule**: Install molecule with pip. It is as simple as running `pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r molecule[ansible]` command.
* **hetzner.hcloud collections(Optional)** :  This depends on your usecase. For the sake of this demo, we will be testing the ansible role on `hetzner` infrastructure by provisioning a VM, connecting over `SSH` & executing the role on the target VM. We install the collections by running `ansible-galaxy collection install hetzner.hcloud` command. 

**Use case** (an example)

In this demo we will apply our OS hardening Ansible role on our VM infrastructure. Let's assume our VM infrastructure has a mix of different OS distributions, major/minor versions. A tiny change made to the hardening role needs to be tested thoroughly on each OS flavor as part of Continuous Integration (CI).

## Step 1 - Adding molecule testing to an existing role

Usual ansible role directory structure would be something like below:

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~/ansible_example_role$ ls -l
total 56
drwxr-xr-x   3 holu  staff    96 21 Nov 12:24 defaults
drwxr-xr-x   3 holu  staff    96 21 Nov 12:24 files
drwxr-xr-x   3 holu  staff    96 21 Nov 12:24 meta
drwxr-xr-x   3 holu  staff    96 21 Nov 12:24 tasks
drwxr-xr-x   3 holu  staff    96 21 Nov 12:24 vars
```

## Step 2 - Adding Molecule to the Collection

Inside the role directory, run `molecule init scenario` command. Upon execution, one will see few directories & files getting created. It would be something like below:

```bash
os_hardening_role/
├── tasks/
│       └── main.yml
└── molecule/
    └── <scenario_name>/
        ├── converge.yml
        ├── create.yml
        ├── destroy.yml
        └── molecule.yml
```

## Step 3 - Role Scenarios

Scenarios are the starting point for a lot of powerful functionality that Molecule offers. For now, we can think of a scenario as a test suite for roles or playbooks within a collection. One can have as many scenarios as they like and Molecule will run one after the other.

## Step 4 - The Scenario Layout

* `create.yml`  is a playbook file used for creating the instances and storing data in instance-config. An example of a Ubuntu 22.04 Hetzner server with ssh key is below.
  
  ```yml
  ---
  - name: Create the test servers
    hosts: localhost
    connection: local
    tasks:
      - name: Create Hetzner cloud server with Ubuntu 22.04
        hetzner.hcloud.server:
          name: "{{ item.name }}"
          server_type: cx11
          image: "{{ item.image }}"
          location: fsn1
          ssh_keys:
            - <your_ssh_key>
          api_token: <your_api_token>
          state: present
        register: vm_output
        with_items:
          - { name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu22, image: ubuntu-22.04 }
          - { name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu20, image: ubuntu-20.04 }

      - name: Generate ssh_config
        template:
          src: ssh_config.j2
          dest: /tmp/ssh_config
        vars:
          hosts: "{{ vm_output.results }}"

      - name: Pause for 1 minute to wait for the SSH process to come up
        pause:
          seconds: 60  
  ```

* `destroy.yml` has the Ansible code for destroying the instances and removing them from instance-config. It's more or less same as `create` expect that `state` has to be marked `absent`. Below is an example:
  
  ```yml
  ---
  - name: Destroy the test servers
    hosts: all
    connection: local
    tasks:
      - name: Delete Hetzner cloud server with Ubuntu {{ item.image }}
        hetzner.hcloud.server:
          name: "{{ item.name }}"
          api_token: <your_api_token>
          state: absent
        with_items:
          - { name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu22, image: ubuntu-22.04 }
          - { name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu20, image: ubuntu-20.04 }
  ```

* `molecule.yml` is the central configuration entry point for Molecule per scenario. With this file, one can configure each tool that Molecule will employ when testing your role.
  
  ```yml
  ---
  dependency:
    name: galaxy
  driver:
    name: default
  platforms:
    - name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu20
      image: "ubuntu-20.04"
    - name: molecule-test-vm-ubuntu22
      image: "ubuntu-22.04"
  provisioner:
    name: ansible
    connection_options:
      ansible_ssh_common_args: " -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey,password -F /tmp/ssh_config -o StrictHostKeychecking=no"
  verifier:
    name: ansible
  scenario:
    name: default
    ## below test sequence starts with `destroy` to ensure we have clean infrastructure state.
    test_sequence:
      - destroy
      - create
      - converge
      - verify
      - destroy
  # you can disable the lint if you want but it is highly recommended to have it enabled as YAML linting is very essential to improve code quality checks
  lint: |
   ansible-lint --exclude molecule/default/
  ```
  
  |              |               |
  | ------------ | ------------- |
  | `dependency` | Molecule uses galaxy development guide by default to resolve your role dependencies. |
  | `driver`     | Molecule uses the Delegated driver by default. Molecule uses the driver to delegate the task of creating instances. |
  | `platforms`  | Molecule relies on this to know which instances to create, name and to which group each instance belongs. If you need to test your role against multiple Ubuntu flavours (18.04, 20.04, 22.04), you can specify that in this section |
  | `provisioner`| Molecule only provides an Ansible provisioner. Ansible manages the life cycle of the instance based on this configuration. |
  | `verifier`   | Molecule uses Ansible by default to provide a way to write specific state checking tests (such as deployment smoke tests) on the target instance. |
  | `scenario`   | Molecule relies on this configuration to control the scenario sequence order. |


* `converge.yml` is the playbook file that contains the call for your role. Molecule will invoke this playbook with ansible-playbook and run it against an instance created by the driver. In our case it's `os_hardening_role`.
  
  ```yml
  ---
  - name: Converge
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    gather_facts: true
    tasks:
      - name: "Include os_hardening_role"
        include_role:
          name: "../../../os_hardening_role/tasks"
    ```

* `verify.yml` is the playbook that validates our roles. As said earlier it's more or less equivalent to `assert`. You could add more checks here. For the sake of this demo, we ensure `root` login is disabled as part of hardening.
  
  ```yml
  ---
  - name: Verify OS Hardening Control
    hosts: all
    become: true
    tasks:
      - name: Ensure root login is disabled
        command: grep '^\s*#*PermitRootLogin' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        register: root_login_config
        failed_when: "'yes' in root_login_config.stdout"
  
      - name: Print root login status
        debug:
          msg: "{{ root_login_config.stdout_lines[0] }}"
  ```

## Step 5 - Build SSH configuration

Ansible primarily relies on `ssh` to connect to target machine to execute tasks. As we are provisioning crash & burn VMs for our testing, we create ssh configuration for each VM to build the inventory and that's passed as `ansible_ssh_common_args` to `ansible` by `molecule`. A simple jinja2 template would be like below:

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~/os_hardening_role$ cat molecule/default/ssh_config.j2 
{% for host in hosts -%}
Host {{ host.hcloud_server.name }}
    HostName {{ host.hcloud_server.ipv4_address }}
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
{% endfor %}
```

### Execute Molecule

Molecule provides commands for manually managing the lifecycle of the instance, scenario, development and testing tools. However, we can also tell Molecule to manage this automatically within a scenario sequence.

```bash
Molecule full lifecycle sequence
└── default
    ├── dependency
    ├── cleanup
    ├── destroy
    ├── syntax
    ├── create
    ├── prepare
    ├── converge
    ├── idempotence
    ├── side_effect
    ├── verify
    ├── cleanup
    └── destroy
```

The full lifecycle sequence can be invoked with the `molecule test` command. 

### Additional lifecycle scenarios

In above demo, we do see `idempotence` which in some cases is quite important & you could plugin such scenario in `molecule.yml`. This way we tell ansible to execute the ansible once again to ensure our role meets the `idempotence` criteria. For more scenario related details you could visit [molecule-scenarios](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/#scenario). 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and tested an Ansible role using Molecule. We covered the basics & testing scenarios on various Ubuntu flavours. Explore further and apply Molecule to your Ansible projects for robust and reliable roles.
