## Introduction

Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is an open-source virtualization platform with support for Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and Linux Containers (LXC). Proxmox provides a web-based management interface, CLI tools, and REST API for management purposes as well as [a great documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/index.html) including detailed Proxmox VE Administration Guide, manual pages and API viewer.

**The tutorial focuses on the network configuration and installation of Proxmox VE on Hetzner servers, since there are some specific guidelines that must be followed.**

## 1 Installation

There are several ways to install Proxmox VE on a dedicated Hetzner root server. You can either install Debian 13 and upgrade to Proxmox later on or use the official image and install it via `qemu`.

### 1.1 Installing Proxmox VE on Debian

* Boot the server into the [Rescue System](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/troubleshooting/hetzner-rescue-system/).
* Run [installimage](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage/), select and install the required Debian 13 (trixie).
* Configure the RAID level, hostname, and partitioning.
* Save the configuration. After the installation completes, reboot the server.
* Once the server becomes reachable again, follow the official guide on how to upgrade from Debian 13 to [Proxmox](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE_on_Debian_13_Trixie).

### 1.2 Installation with ZFS

Proxmox can also be installed via `qemu` using the official [ISO](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads). In this method, you start the installer in a virtual machine from the Hetzner Rescue system. The network, however needs to be configured before the server is rebooted since the network interface is virtualized. The drives inside the VM will be shown as `/dev/vdX` which is normal because they are attached using the **virtio** interface.

#### Preparing the Environment 

Before starting with the installation process forward a local port and connect to your server with the following command:
```bash
ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 root@your_server_ip
```
Copy the link address of your image and download it in the Rescue system using `wget`:
```bash
wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/proxmox-ve_9.0-1.iso
```
Now you can start a virtual machine in the Rescue system, pass the drives, and boot from the ISO. Copy the following command:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -m 16G \
  -boot d \
  -cdrom ./proxmox-ve_9.0-1.iso \
  -drive file=/dev/nvme0n1,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -drive file=/dev/nvme1n1,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \
  -vnc 127.0.0.1:0
```
(The ` -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \` line is for **EFI** servers only. Remove the line if the BIOS is set to **legacy**. If you are unsure you can use `[ -d "/sys/firmware/efi" ] && echo "UEFI" || echo "BIOS"` to check if the server is on EFI.)
```bash
root@rescue ~ # [ -d "/sys/firmware/efi" ] && echo "UEFI" || echo "BIOS"
UEFI
```

(If you have SATA drives rename the devices to `/dev/sda` for example instead of `/dev/nvme0n1`)

**Use a `VNC client` and connect to `127.0.0.1`, the installation should appear.**

**Please note that the VNC client may timeout once you press `install`, simply reconnect to `127.0.0.1`.**

#### Configure the main interface

Once the installation process has finished, stop QEMU (`ctrl + c` in the terminal window). Before rebooting the server, the network interface name must be adjusted in `/etc/network/interfaces`. In order to figure out the true interface name, you can use the `predict-check` command:
```bash
root@rescue ~ # predict-check 
eth0 -> enp0s31f6
```
So in this example `enp0s31f6` would be the true interface name. The interface that is configured in the Rescue system can be viewed with `netdata`:
```bash
root@rescue ~ # netdata
Network data:
   eth0  LINK: yes
         MAC:  aa:bb:cc:dd:cc:ff
         IP:   192.168.1.100/24
         IPv6: (none)
         Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver
```
Now boot up Proxmox using the same mehtod as earlier but without the installation medium and connect to `127.0.0.1`. Copy the following command:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -m 16G \
  -boot d \
  -drive file=/dev/nvme0n1,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -drive file=/dev/nvme1n1,format=raw,if=virtio \
  -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \
  -vnc 127.0.0.1:0
```
Login and edit the network configuration in `/etc/network/interfaces`:
```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
Adjust the interface name, save and reboot the server. For example this would be a basic configuration:
```bash
root@pve:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto enp0s31f6
iface enp0s31f6 inet static
        address your_server_ip/32
        gateway your_server_gateway
```
## 2 Network Configuration

Hetzner has a strict IP/MAC binding to ensure security and prevent spoofing. In some scenarios, only a routed setup is possible. For example, additional subnets, single failover IPs and failover subnets are always MAC-bound and statically routed on the main IP address of the server, and can only be configured in a **routed** setup.

#### Enable IP Forwarding on the Host

With a routed setup, the bridges (`vmbr0`, for example) are not connected with the physical interface. You need to activate IP forwarding on the host system. Please note that packet forwarding between network interfaces is disabled for the default Hetzner installation.

For IPv4 and IPv6:
```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding
```
Apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl restart systemd-sysctl
```
Check if the forwarding is active:
```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding
```

#### Add the network configuration

Choose one of the variants:

* [Routed Setup](#21-routed-setup)
* [Bridged Setup](#22-bridged-setup)
* [vSwitch with a public subnet](#23-vswitch-with-a-public-subnet)<br>
  <small>» Assign IP addresses to VM's/Containers from a vSwitch with a public subnet.</small>
* [Hetzner Cloud Network](#24-hetzner-cloud-network)<br>
  <small>» Establish a connection between the virtual machines/LXC in Proxmox and the Hetzner cloud network.</small><br>
* [Masquerading (NAT)](#25-masquerading-nat)<br> 
  <small>» Enable VMs with private IPs to have internet access through the host's public IP.</small><br>

### 2.1 Routed Setup

In a routed configuration, the host system's bridge IP address serves as the gateway by default, and manual route addition to a virtual machine is required when the extra IP does not belong to the same subnet. That's why we will set the mask to `/32`, because devices such as vmbr0 inherently route traffic only for IP addresses that fall within the same subnet.  By using a `/32` mask, each additional IP is treated as its own unique network entity which will ensure that the traffic reaches its correct destination even if the additional IP is not from the same subnet.

* **Host system Routed**
  
  We will use the following example addresses to represent a real-use-case scenario:
  
  - Main IP: `198.51.100.10/24`
  - Gateway of the main IP: `198.51.100.1/24`
  - Additional Subnet: `203.0.113.0/24`
  - Additional single IP (foreign subnet): `192.0.2.20/24`
  - Additional single IP (same subnet): `198.51.100.30/24`
  - Failover single IP: `172.17.234.100/32`
  - Failover subnet: `172.17.234.0/24`
  - IPv6: `2001:DB8::/64`

**Please note that you will have to restart the network after applying the network configuration for the Proxmox host to add the static routes. If virtual machines or containers are running during the network restart, you will need to stop (not just restart) and then start them again. This ensures that their point-to-point connections to the host are recreated properly.**
```bash
systemctl restart networking
```
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  iface lo inet6 loopback
  
  auto enp0s31f6
  iface enp0s31f6 inet static

          bridge-ports none
          bridge-stp off
          bridge-fd 0
  ```

<br>

* **Guest system Routed** (Debian 12)
  
  The IP of the bridge in the host system is always used as the gateway, i.e. the main IP for individual IPs and the IP from the subnet configured in the host system for subnets.
  
  Guest configuration:
  
  * With an additional IP from the same subnet:
    ```Go
    # /etc/network/interfaces
    
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
            address 198.51.100.30/32     # Additional IP
            gateway 198.51.100.10        # Main IP
      
    # IPv6
    iface ens18 inet6 static
            address 2001:DB8::4/64   # IPv6 address of the subnet
            gateway 2001:DB8::3      # Bridge Address
    ```
  
  * With a foreign Additional IP:
    ```Go
    # /etc/network/interfaces
    
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
            address 192.0.2.20/32        # Additional IP from a foreign subnet
            gateway 198.51.100.10        # Main IP   
    ```
  
  * With an IP assigned from the additional subnet
    ```Go
    # /etc/network/interfaces
    
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
            address 203.0.113.10/24      # Subnet IP
            gateway 203.0.113.1          # Gateway is the IP of the bridge (vmbr1) 
    ```
  * With an IP assigned from the failover subnet
    ```Go
    # /etc/network/interfaces
    
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
            address 172.17.234.10/24      # Subnet IP
            gateway 172.17.234.1          # Gateway is the IP of the bridge (vmbr2) 
    ```
  * Single failover IP
    ```Go
    # /etc/network/interfaces
    
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto ens18
    iface ens18 inet static
            address 172.17.234.100/32      # Failvoer IP
            gateway 198.51.100.10          # The gateway IP is the main IP
    ```

### 2.2 Bridged Setup

When setting up Proxmox in bridged mode, it is absolutely crucial to request virtual MAC addresses for each IP address through the Robot Panel. In this mode, the host acts as a transparent bridge and is not part of the routing path. This means that packets arriving at the router will have the source MAC address of the virtual machines. If the source MAC address is not recognized by the router, the traffic will be flagged as "Abuse" and might lead to the server being blocked. Therefore, it is essential to request virtual MAC addresses in the Robot Panel.

* **Host system Bridged**
  
  We configure only the main IP of the server here. The additional IPs will be configured in the Guest Systems.
  
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  auto enp0s31f6
  iface enp0s31f6 inet manual
  
  auto vmbr0
  iface vmbr0 inet static
          address 198.51.100.10/32    # Main IP
          gateway 198.51.100.1        # Gateway
          bridge-ports enp0s31f6
          bridge-stp off
          bridge-fd 0
  ```

<br>

* **Guest system Bridged** (Debian 12)
  
  Here we use the gateway of the additional IP, or if the additional IP is within the same subnet as the main IP, we use the gateway of the main IP.
  
  Static configuration:
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto ens18
  iface ens18 inet static
          address 192.0.2.20/32         # Additional IP 
          gateway 192.0.2.1             # Additional Gateway IP
  ```
  
  In bridged mode, DHCP can also be used to automatically configure the network settings. However, it is essential to configure the virtual machine to use the virtual MAC address obtained from the Robot Panel for the specific IP configuration.
  
  ![](images/d5ce2092-8887-4695-9bd1-ba9e3c8e3f71.png)
  
  You can also adjust this manually in the Virtual Machine itself, in `/etc/network/interfaces`:
  
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  auto ens18
  iface ens18 inet dhcp
          hwaddress ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff # The MAC address is just an example
  ```
  
  You can do the same thing for LXC containers via the Proxmox GUI. Simply click on the container, navigate to "Network", and then click on the bridge. Select DHCP and add the correct MAC address from the Robot Panel (in our case the example would be `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`):
  
  ![](images/e569dbf9-2431-4973-abad-d950b6b75eda.png)

<br>

### 2.3 vSwitch with a public subnet

Proxmox can also be set up to link directly with a Hetzner vSwitch that manages routing for a public subnet, allowing IP addresses from that subnet to be assigned directly to VM's and containers. The setup has to be a bridged setup and a virtual interface has to be created in order for the packets to be able to reach the vSwitch. The bridge does not require to be VLAN-aware and no VLAN configuration has to be made within the VM or LXC containers, the tagging is here done by the subinterface, in our example the `enp0s31f6.4009`. Every packet that goes through the interface will be tagged with the appropriate VLAN ID. (Please note that this configuration is meant for the LXC/VM's, If you would like the host itself to be able to communicate with the vSwitch you will have to create an additional [Routing table](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch#server-configuration-linux).) In this case we will use `203.0.113.0/24` as an example subnet.

* **Host system configuration:**
  ```Bash
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto enp0s31f6.4009
  iface enp0s31f6.4009 inet manual
  
  auto vmbr4009
  iface vmbr4009 inet static
          bridge-ports enp0s31f6.4009
          bridge-stp off
          bridge-fd 0
          mtu 1400
  #vSwitch Subnet 203.0.113.0/24
  ```

<br>

* **Guest system configuration:**
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  auto ens18
  iface ens18 inet static
          address 203.0.113.2/24      # Subnet IP from the vSwitch
          gateway 203.0.113.1         # vSwitch Gateway
  ```

---------

<br>

### 2.4 Hetzner Cloud Network

It is also possible to establish a connection between the virtual machines/LXC in Proxmox with the Hetzner Cloud Network. For the sake of this example, let's assume that you have already setup your Cloud Network and have added the vSwitch with the following configuration:

- `192.168.0.0/16` - Your cloud network (parent network)
- `192.168.0.0/24` - Cloud server subnet
- `192.168.1.0/24` - vSwitch (#12345)

The configuration should look something like this:

![](images/3935fcac-0bc7-47c1-8965-511f11d7f72c.png)

Similarly as in the example before, we will first create a virtual interface and define the VLAN ID, so in our case that would be the `enp0s31f6.4000`. We will have to add the route to the Cloud Network `192.168.0.0/16` via the vSwitch. Please note that adding a route to the Hetzner Cloud network and assigning an IP address from the private subnet range of the vSwitch to the bridge is only necessary if the Proxmox host itself is to communicate with the Hetzner Cloud network.

* **Host system configuration:**
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto enp0s31f6.4000
  iface enp0s31f6.4000 inet manual
  
  auto vmbr4000
  iface vmbr4000 inet static
          address 192.168.1.10/24
          bridge-ports enp0s31f6.4000
          bridge-stp off
          bridge-fd 0
          mtu 1400
          post-up ip route add 192.168.0.0/16 via 192.168.1.1 dev vmbr4000
          
  #vSwitch-to-cloud Private Subnet 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

<br>

* **Guest system configuration**
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  auto ens18
  iface ens18 inet static
          address 192.168.1.2/24
          gateway 192.168.1.1
  ```

<br>

### 2.5 Masquerading (NAT)
  
  Exposing the virtual machines/LXC containers to the internet is also possible without configuring/having any further public additional IP addresses. Hetzner has a strict IP/MAC binding which means that if the traffic is not routed properly, it will cause abuse and can lead to server blockings. In order to avoid this problem, we can route the traffic from the LXC/VM's through the main interface of the host. This ensures that the MAC address is the same across all network packets. Masquerading enables virtual machines with private IP addresses to have internet access through the host's public IP address for outbound communications. Iptables modifies each outgoing data packet to seem as if it is coming from the host and incoming replies are adjusted so they can be directed back to the initial sender.
  
  ```Go
  # /etc/network/interfaces
  
  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback
  
  iface lo inet6 loopback
  
  auto enp0s31f6
  iface enp0s31f6 inet static
          address 198.51.100.10/24
          gateway 198.51.100.1
          post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

          #post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i enp0s31f6 -p tcp -m multiport ! --dports 22,8006 -j DNAT --to 172.16.16.2
          #post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i enp0s31f6 -p tcp -m multiport ! --dports 22,8006 -j DNAT --to 172.16.16.2
  
  auto vmbr4
  iface vmbr4 inet static
          address 172.16.16.1/24
          bridge-ports none
          bridge-stp off
          bridge-fd 0
          post-up   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s '172.16.16.0/24' -o enp0s31f6 -j MASQUERADE
          post-down iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s '172.16.16.0/24' -o enp0s31f6 -j MASQUERADE
  #NAT/Masq
  ```
  
  Please note that these rules (bellow) are not necessary for the LXC/VM's to have internet access. This rule is optional and serves the purpose of external accessibility to a specific VM/Container. It redirects all incoming traffic, besides on ports 22 and 8006 (here, 22 is excluded so that you can still connect to Proxmox via SSH, and 8006 is the port for the web interface), to a designated virtual machine at `172.16.16.2` within the subnet. This is a common scenario/setup for router VM's like pfSense where all incoming traffic will be redirected to the router VM and then routed accordingly.

<br>

  ```Go
  post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i enp0s31f6 -p tcp -m multiport ! --dports 22,8006 -j DNAT --to 172.16.16.2
  post-down iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i enp0s31f6 -p tcp -m multiport ! --dports 22,8006 -j DNAT --to 172.16.16.2
  ```

## Security

The web interface is protected by two different authentication methods:

* Proxmox VE standard authentication (Proxmox proprietary authentication)
* Linux PAM standard authentication

Nevertheless, additional protection measures would be recommended to protect against the exploitation of any security vulnerabilities or various other attacks.

Here are several possibilities:

- [Two-Factor-Authentication](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Two-Factor_Authentication)
- [Fail2ban against Brute-force attacks](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Fail2ban)
- [Securing the SSH Service](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/securing-ssh)

## Conclusion

By now, you should have installed and configured Proxmox VE as a virtualization platform on your server.

Proxmox VE also supports clustering. Please find details in tutorial "[Setting up your own public cloud with Proxmox on Hetzner bare metal](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/hyperconverged-proxmox-cloud)".
