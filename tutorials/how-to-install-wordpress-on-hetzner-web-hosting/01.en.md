## Introduction

WordPress is one of the world's most widely used content management systems (CMS). It allows you to easily create, manage and maintain websites, blogs and even online shops. No in-depth programming knowledge is required.

## Step 1 - Installing WordPress

**Here's how to install WordPress on your web hosting package:**

1. Select a directory on your web space where you want to install WordPress (e.g. /wordpress or the main directory). 

2. Start the installation via our hosting panel by clicking on ‘Install’ (e.g. with Softaculous or a 1-click installer). 

3. Please note: If a warning appears stating that the selected directory already contains files, check whether you still need them. If in doubt, create a backup first.

4. Once the installation is complete, click on 'Continue'.

The WordPress files are now installed and the basic configuration is complete. The next step is to set up your WordPress website.

## Step 2 - Setting up your WordPress site
