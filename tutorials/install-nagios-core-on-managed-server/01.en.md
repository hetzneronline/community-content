## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to install a rootless Nagios Core monitoring system with a basic configuration on a Managed Server. Before we can run Nagios we need to compile it fronm source. After the installation of Nagios a few small special adjustments in its configurations are necessary to make it work with the Managed Server.

**Prerequisites**

- [Managed Server](https://www.hetzner.com/managed-server?country=ot) with enabled SSH access
- Hetzner Development Package (hos-dev) -> please ask the support

## Step 1 - Install Nagios Core and Monitoring Plugens

First we need to download and and compile various sources.

Before we start, create a directory for the sources to keep the home directory clean.

```bash
cd
mkdir src
cd src
```

### Step 1.1 - Nagios Core source installation and security preparation

Create a directory in public_html for installation and secure it with .htaccess.

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios
echo "Require all denied" > /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/.htaccess
```

Proceed with the compilation of Nagios.

- Always check [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios/) for newer stable versions

```bash
wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/nagios/nagios-4.x/nagios-4.5.9/nagios-4.5.9.tar.gz
tar xzvf nagios-4.5.9.tar.gz
cd nagios-nagios-4.5.9
./configure --prefix=/usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios --with-cgiurl=/cgi-bin --with-htmurl=/ --with-nagios-user=holu --with-nagios-group=holu --with-command-group=holu
make all -j $(($(grep ^cpu\ cores /proc/cpuinfo | uniq | sed s/[^0-9]//g)+1))
make install
make install-commandmode
make install-config
cp -r contrib/eventhandlers/ /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/libexec/
cd ..
```

### Step 1.2 - Monitoring Plugins source installation

Finally compile the Monitoring Plugins.

- Always check [here](https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/) for newer stable versions

```bash
wget https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/download/monitoring-plugins-2.4.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf monitoring-plugins-2.4.0.tar.gz 
cd monitoring-plugins-2.4.0
./configure --prefix=/usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios --with-nagios-user=holu --with-nagios-group=holu
make -j $(($(grep ^cpu\ cores /proc/cpuinfo | uniq | sed s/[^0-9]//g)+1))
make install
```

## Step 2 - Basic configuration of Nagios

### Step 2.1 - Set a valid recipient email address to contacts.cfg for notifications

To receive email notifications and avoid undeliverable emails from your Nagios server you should replace the default recipient address with a valid address.

```bash
vim /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
```
Hit `i` to switch to "insert mode" and replace the nagiosadmin email `holu@localhost` with `recipient@example.com`:

```
###############################################################################
#
# CONTACTS
#
###############################################################################

# Just one contact defined by default - the Nagios admin (that's you)
# This contact definition inherits a lot of default values from the
# 'generic-contact' template which is defined elsewhere.

define contact {

    contact_name            nagiosadmin             ; Short name of user
    use                     generic-contact         ; Inherit default values from generic-contact template (defined above)
    alias                   Nagios Admin            ; Full name of user
    email                   recipient@example.com ; <<***** CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS ******
}
```

### Step 2.2 - Set a valid sender email address in commands.cfg for notifications

By default Nagios uses a default address to send email notifications. This may lead to blacklistings and spam detection of the emails. We will set a From/envelope-from with a valid address to avoid this. 

```bash
vim /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg
```

Hit `i` to switch to "insert mode" and add the `-r sender@example.com` between the `/usr/bin/mail` and the `-s` in the command_line for the command_names `notify-host-by-email` and `notify-service-by-email`:

```
################################################################################
#
# SAMPLE NOTIFICATION COMMANDS
#
# These are some example notification commands.  They may or may not work on
# your system without modification.  As an example, some systems will require
# you to use "/usr/bin/mailx" instead of "/usr/bin/mail" in the commands below.
#
################################################################################

define command {

    command_name    notify-host-by-email
    command_line    /usr/bin/printf "%b" "***** Nagios *****\n\nNotification Type: $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$\nHost: $HOSTNAME$\nState: $HOSTSTATE$\nAddress: $HOSTADDRESS$\nInfo: $HOSTOUTPUT$\n\nDate/Time: $LONGDATETIME$\n" | /usr/bin/mail -r sender@example.com -s "** $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ Host Alert: $HOSTNAME$ is $HOSTSTATE$ **" $CONTACTEMAIL$
}



define command {

    command_name    notify-service-by-email
    command_line    /usr/bin/printf "%b" "***** Nagios *****\n\nNotification Type: $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$\n\nService: $SERVICEDESC$\nHost: $HOSTALIAS$\nAddress: $HOSTADDRESS$\nState: $SERVICESTATE$\n\nDate/Time: $LONGDATETIME$\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n$SERVICEOUTPUT$\n" | /usr/bin/mail -r sender@example.org -s "** $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ Service Alert: $HOSTALIAS$/$SERVICEDESC$ is $SERVICESTATE$ **" $CONTACTEMAIL$
}
```

## Step 3 - Final preparation for webserver and go live

### Step 3.1 - Create public directory 

Create the public directory. Later it will contain all files and scripts for the Nagios web gui.

```bash
mkdir /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/public
```

### Step 3.2 - konsoleH settings for password protection and document root

Log into [konsoleH](https://konsoleh.hetzner.com), click on "Products", select your domain "example.com" and goto "Services" -> "Server Configuration". Now select the public directory in the list and click on the red button "Password protection".

![konsoleH config 1](images/khconf1.jpg)

Click on the red button "Add user".

![konsoleH config 2](images/khconf2.jpg)

For the password protection, please set the user "nagiosadmin" (literally), set a secure password and an Area/AuthName, then click on the red button "Save".

![konsoleH config 3](images/khconf3.jpg)

Go back to "Services" -> "Server Configuration", select the public directory in the list and click on the red button "Change document root".

![konsoleH config 4](images/khconf4.jpg)

### Step 3.3 - Add Symlinks for public directory

Create symbolic links to fill the public directory with the required content.

```bash
ln -s /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/share/* /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/public/
ln -s /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/sbin /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/public/cgi-bin
```

### Step 3.4 - Start Nagios service

Start the Nagios service in background.

```bash
/usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/bin/nagios /usr/www/users/holu/example_com/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg &
```

If you want to run the process as permanent service, please consider to ask the support for process releases of `nagios`.

If you want to start Nagios automatically on server restart, please add a "@reboot" Cronjob in konsoleH ([Hetzner Docs: Cron Job Manager](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/account-management/configuration/cronmanager)).

### Step 3.5 - Test Nagios web gui

Open the website and login with the "nagiosadmin" user.
