## Introduction

In this tutorial we cover how to install OpenLDAP server on Debian 10.
This tutorial should be more or less compatible with all Linux distros.

OpenLDAP is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server which can be used to authenticate users against a centralized authority server.

## Step 1 - Update all packages

First we want to make sure that our server is fully updated and upgraded. This can be achieved with:

 ```bash
 apt update && apt upgrade -y
 ```

## Step 2 - Install OpenLDAP package

OpenLDAP requires two packages to function:
slapd - LDAP standalone daemon
ldap-utils - Useful tools for local LDAP management

To install these packages type

```bash
apt install slapd ldap-utils -y
```

## Step 3 - Set password for slapd

After you have installed required packages an install prompt will appear:

![slapd install prompt](images/slapd.png)

Here you need to type your new LDAP admin password.
It's always recommended to use strong and complex passwords.

## Step 4 - Verify install of slapd

Now we can verify if the installation was successful:

```bash
slapcat
```

This command outputs current domain structure.

## Step 5 - Edit directory domain

You need edit ldap.conf to fit your needs.

```bash
nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
```

```
#
# LDAP Defaults
#

# See ldap.conf(5) for details
# This file should be world readable but not world writable.

#BASE    dc=example,dc=com
#URI     ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666

#SIZELIMIT      12
#TIMELIMIT      15
#DEREF          never

# TLS certificates (needed for GnuTLS)
TLS_CACERT      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

```
Uncomment:  

#BASE    dc=example,dc=com  
#URI     ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666  

and modify BASE to fit your needs.
I'm using openldap-tutorial.local in my config.
```

```
# LDAP Defaults
#

# See ldap.conf(5) for details
# This file should be world readable but not world writable.

BASE    dc=openldap-tutorial,dc=local
URI     ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666

#SIZELIMIT      12
#TIMELIMIT      15
#DEREF          never

# TLS certificates (needed for GnuTLS)
TLS_CACERT      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

## Step 6 - Configure OpenLDAP

Now we can configure OpenLDAP:

```bash
dpkg-reconfigure slapd
```

Now enter same base name which you configured on previous step.

![openldap dns](images/openldap_dns.png)

Then you need enter organization name:

![openldap org name](images/openldap-org_name.png)

Then enter your LDAP admin password configured on step 3.

When installer ask which database to use for backend, select MDB as it's most modern.

![openldap database](images/openldap_db.png)

Select no when installer ask if database should be removed when slapd is purged.

![openldap purge](images/openldap-purge.png)

Allow installer to move old database.

![openldap move database](images/openldap-move-db.png)

## Step 7 - Verify changed domain structure

```bash
slapcat
```

We can now notice that our distinguished name (dn) is changed.

![openldap new structure](images/new_slapcat.png)

## Conclusion

Now your OpenLDAP server is successfully configured and is ready to use. You can use shell or GUI to manage it.

A couple of good GUI options are:
phpLDAPadmin
Apache Directory Studio
