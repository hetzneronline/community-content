## Introduction

This tutorials is about installing and configuring SteamCMD on Linux systems.
The installation and setup of game servers is covered in subsequent tutorials.

Game server tutorials:
+ [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-gameserver-csgo)

**Requirements**

+ An x86 / x64 compatible system
+ Linux operating system

## Step 1 - Preparations

Create a new user to run SteamCMD and the game servers:
```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/false steamcmd
```

## Step 2 - Installation

Install dependencies for SteamCMD.

Ubuntu/Debian 64-Bit:
```bash
apt-get install lib32gcc1 libstdc++6:i386
```

RedHat/CentOS:
```bash
yum install glibc libstdc++
```

RedHat/CentOS 64-Bit:
```bash
yum install glibc.i686 libstdc++.i686
```

Create the installation directory:
```bash
mkdir /opt/steamcmd && chown steamcmd:steamcmd /opt/steamcmd
```

Switch to the created `steamcmd` user:
```bash
su --shell /bin/bash steamcmd
```

Download the latest version of SteamCMD:
```bash
cd /opt/steamcmd && curl -sqL "https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz" | tar zxvf -
```

## Step 3 - System links (Optional)

Create a link to allow a system-wide call to SteamCMD:
```bash
ln -s /opt/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh /usr/local/bin/steamcmd
ln -s /opt/steamcmd/linux32/ /usr/local/bin/linux32
ln -s /opt/steamcmd/linux64/ /usr/local/bin/linux64
```

SteamCMD can then be started from anywhere using the `steamcmd` command.

## Conclusion

This tutorial is a starting point to installing game servers via SteamCMD.
