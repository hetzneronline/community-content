## Introduction

A further option to secure the SSH login of your server is the verification of host key and client key by using a Certificate Authority (CA).

With this verification it is possible to log in to your server without copying your public SSH key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

This means that the issued certificates can be time limited, or revoked prematurely. This is useful if many servers are managed by several users.

In this tutorial only one server will be managed. For bigger setups a naming scheme for host keys and client keys is recommended.  

**This tutorial was tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and OpenSSH 8.3.**

**Prerequisites:**

#### CA

* CA key (User): `~/.ssh/ca_user_key`
* CA key (Hosts): `~/.ssh/ca_host_key`

#### Server (should trust the CA)

* Username: `holu`,`root`
* FQDN: `host.example.com`
* `sshd` configuration: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* host key: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`
* host certificate: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`

#### Client (should be able to log in to holu@host.example.com via certificate)

* User: `client`
* SSH user key: `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* client certificate: `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`

## Step 1 - create an SSH CA

This step shows how to create simple key pairs for the CA. These key pairs are used for signing the user certificates and host certificates only.

Creating the key pair

```bash
SSH keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -t ed25519 && SSH keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_host_key -t ed25519
```

Now the key pairs are located in `~/.ssh/`.

## Step 2 - Signing the host keys

Now the host key of the server must be signed with the `ca_host_key`.
For clarity reasons it would be better to save the host certificates & client certificates in separate directories.

Create certificate directories: (optional)

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh/clients ~/.ssh/hosts
```

Signing the host key `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`.

```bash
SSH keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca_host_key -I example_host_ID -n host.example.com -V +52w /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
```

* -s: CA key
* -I: HostID for host certificate
* -n: principal contains the IP and/or FQDN of this server
* -V: validity of certificate

Now the public host key should be signed with `ca_host_key`. If this was successful, you should find the host certificate at `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`.

## Step 2.1 - Establishing the host certificate

The host certificate and the public CA host key `ca_user_key.pub` need to be established.

In this tutorial these files are: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub` & `~/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub`

In order to keep the `sshd` configuration clean, this tutorial creates an additional configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf`.

By adding the following line to the `sshd` configuration (if not available) this additional configuration will be included.

```bash
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

```bash
echo "TrustedUserCAKeys ~/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub" > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
echo "HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
```

In order to validate and activate the configuration changes, execute the following commands.

```bash
sshd -T -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Step 3 - Signing the client keys

Now the public SSH user key for the client needs to be signed. In this tutorial the key is copied to `~/.ssh/clients/`.

For signing this key, use the following command.

```bash
SSH keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -I example_client -n holu -V +10h ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* -I: ClientID for certificate
* -n: This parameter determines which user names the client can use log on to the host.

Now the public SSH user key should be signed with the CA user key. If this was successful, you should find the client certificate  
at `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

### Step 3.1 - Establishing the client certificate on client side

Now the client certificate must be copied to the client machine.

In this tutorial it is copied to `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

It may be necessary to adjust the file permissions of the certificate. This is possible with the following command.

```bash
sudo chown client:client /home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub
```

## Step 4 - Revoke certificates manually (optional)

In order to revoke certificates manually, you have to create a `revoked_keys` file and adjust the `sshd` configuration.

In this tutorial the `revoked_keys` file is located in `/etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/`

```bash
mkdir /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d && touch /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
echo "RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
```

**The `sshd` configuration should be tested and activated as shown in Step 2.**

To revoke a client certificate execute the following command.

```bash
SSH keygen -k -u -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Conclusion

The standard configuration is finished. Now the client is able to log in to the host by using the certificate and the client SSH key.

To deploy this configuration setup automatically you can use Puppet or Ansible.
