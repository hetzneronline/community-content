## Introduction

[Setting up an SSH key](/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) is a detailed tutorial about SSH keys and setup with the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

In this tutorial we will explore a further option to secure the SSH login of your server with the verification of client key by using a Certificate Authority (CA).
With this verification it is possible to log in to your server without copying your public SSH key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

This means that the issued certificates can be time limited, or revoked prematurely.
This is useful if many servers are managed by several users.

In this tutorial only one server will be managed.
For bigger setups a naming scheme for client keys is recommended.

This tutorial was tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and OpenSSH 8.3.

**Prerequisites**

For this tutorial you will need:

* Root access to server.
* `sshd` installed on a server.
* `ssh` client installed on a client computer.
* `ssh-keygen` on both client and server (basically provided together with an `ssh` client).

## Step 1 - Create an SSH Certificate Authority

This step consists of two substeps.
Both of them are performed on **server**.

### Step 1.1 - Create a New SSH Key Pair

We will use a separate key pair for CA.
This key pair is used for signing the user public keys only.

Create a new key:

```console
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -t ed25519
```

### Step 1.2 - Change SSH Server Settings

In order to keep the `sshd` configuration clean, we create an additional configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ca.conf`.
Put the following line into that file:

```text
TrustedUserCAKeys /root/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub
```

And also make sure that `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` has the following line:

```text
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

### Step 1.3 - Apply New Settings

Once you have changed `sshd` configuration, validate it with following command:

```console
sshd -t
```

This command shows nothing if configuration is correct.
Otherwise, it shows an error message.

Now reload `sshd` configuration via systemctl:

```console
systemctl reload sshd
```

## Step 2 - Sign the Client Key

Now the public SSH user key for the client needs to be signed.

We will store client keys in `~/.ssh/clients/` directory on **server**.
Create it with command:

```console
mkdir -v ~/.ssh/clients/
```

After that, copy a client's public key into that directory.
Let's say you saved it in `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub` file.

For signing this key, use the following command:

```console
ssh-keygen \
  -s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key \
  -I example_client \
  -n holu,root \
  -V +10h \
  ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* `-s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key` — Specify signing CA key.
* `-I example_client` — Key identifier for client's certificate.
* `-n holu,root` — Which usernames (comma separated list) the client can use to log in to the host.
* `-V +10h` — Validity of certificate, 10 hours starting from now (optional).
* `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub` — Path to the key to be singed.

If this was successful, you should find the client certificate at `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

### Step 3 - Establish the Client Certificate on Client Side

Now the client certificate must be copied to the client machine.

In this tutorial it is copied to `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

It may be necessary to adjust the file permissions of the certificate.
This is possible with the following command:

```console
chown -v client:client /home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub
```

Now the client can connect to the server:

```console
ssh -l holu <server address>
```

## Step 3 - Revoke Certificates Manually (optional)

We will use Key Revocation List (KRL) file for revocation purposes.

In order to revoke certificates, you have to create a `revoked_keys` file and adjust the `sshd` configuration.

In this tutorial the `revoked_keys` file is located in `/etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/`
Create a directory and an empty file with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -v /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d
touch /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
```

Also add the following line into `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ca.conf` file:

```text
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
```

**The `sshd` configuration should be tested and activated as shown in [Step 1.3 - Apply New Settings](#step-13---apply-new-settings).**

To fill the KRL file with the **first** revoked certification, execute the following command.

```console
ssh-keygen -k -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* `-k` — Tells `ssh-keygen` that it works with KRL file format.
* `-f <path>` — Path to KRL file.
* `<path>` — Final argument is a public key to revoke.

To revoke **additional** certificates add `-u` argument, which means to update the KRL with the additional key.

```console
ssh-keygen -k -u -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Conclusion

The standard configuration is finished.
Now the client is able to log in to the host by using the certificate and the client SSH key.

To deploy this configuration setup automatically you can use Puppet or Ansible.
