## Introduction

A further option to secure the SSH login of your server is the verification of Host-Key and Client-Key by using a Certificate Authority (CA).
With this verification it is possible to log in to your server without copy your public SSH-Key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
So it is possible to limit the access to a server for a specific period of time. This is usefull if many servers are managed by several users.
In this tutorial only one server will be managed. For bigger setups a adapted naming scheme for Host-Keys and Client-Keys is recommended.
**This tutorial is tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and OpenSSH 8.3.**

**Prerequisites:**

#### CA

* CA-Key (User): `~/.ssh/ca_user_key`
* CA-Key (Hosts): `~/.ssh/ca_host_key`

#### server (should trust the CA)

* Username: `holu`,`root`
* FQDN: `host.example.com`
* `sshd` configuration: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* Host-Key: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`
* Host-Certificate: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`

#### client (should be able to log in to holu@host.example.com via certificate)
* User: `client`
* SSH-User-Key: `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* Client-Certificate: `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`

## Step 1 - create CA

This step shows how to create simple keypairs for the CA. These keypairs are used for signing the User-Certificates and Host-Certificates only.

Creating the keypair
```
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -t ed25519 && ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_host_key -t ed25519
```
Now the keypairs are located in `~/.ssh/`.

## Step 2 - Signing the Host-Keys

Now the Host-Key of the server must be signed with the `ca_host_key`.
For clarity reasons it would be better so save the Host-Certificates & Client-Certificates in separate directories.

Create certificate directories: (optional)
```
mkdir ~/.ssh/clients ~/.ssh/hosts
```
Signing the Host-Key `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`.
```
ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca_host_key -I example_host_ID -n host.example.com -V +52w /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
```

* -s: CA-Key
* -I: HostID for host certificate
* -n: principal contains the IP or FQDN of this server
* -V: validity of certificate

Now the public Host-Key should be signed with `ca_host_key`. If this was successfull, you should find the Host-Certificate  
at `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`.

## Step 2.1 - Establishing the Host-Certificate

The Host-Certificate and the public CA-Host-Key `ca_user_key.pub` need to be established.
In this tutorial these files are: `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub` & `~/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub`

In order to keep the `sshd` configuration clean, this tutorial creates an additional configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf`.
By adding the following line to the `sshd` configuration (if not available) this additional configuration will be included.
```
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```
```
echo "TrustedUserCAKeys ~/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub" > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
echo "HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
```
In order to validate and activate the configuration changes, execute the following commands.
```
sshd -T -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Step 3 - Signing the Client-Keys

Now the public SSH-User-Key for the client needs to be signed. In this tutorial the key is copied to `~/.ssh/clients/`.
For signing this key, use the following command.
```
ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -I example_client -n holu -V +10h ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* -I: ClientID for certificate
* -n: This parameter determines which user names the client can use log on to the host.

Now the public SSH-User-Key should be signed with the CA-User-Key. If this was successfull, you should find the Client-Certificate  
at `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

### Step 3.1 - Establishing the Client-Certificate on client side

Now the Client-Certificate must be copied to the client machine.
In this tutorial it is copied to `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

It may be necessary to adjust the file permissions of the certificate. This is possible with the following command.
```
sudo chown client:client /home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub
```

## Step 4 - Revoke certificates manually (optional)

In order to revoke certificates manually, you have to create a `revoked_keys` file and adjust the `sshd` configuration.
In this tutorial the `revoked_keys` file is located in `/etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/`
```
mkdir /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d && touch /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
echo "RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/certificate.conf
```
**The `sshd` configuration should be tested and activated as shown in Step 2** 

To revoke a Client-Certificate execute the following command.
```
ssh-keygen -k -u -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Conclusion

The standard configuration is finished. Now the client is able to log in to the host by using the certificate and the Client-SSH-Key.
To deploy this configuration setup automaticly you can use Puppet or Ansible.
