## Introduction

"[Setting up an SSH key](/tutorials/howto-ssh-key)" is a detailed tutorial about SSH keys and setup with the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

In this tutorial, we will explore a further option to secure the SSH login of your server with the verification of the client key by using a Certificate Authority (CA).
With this verification, it is possible to log in to your server without copying your public SSH key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

This means that the issued certificates can be time-limited, or revoked prematurely.
This is useful if many servers are managed by several users.

In this tutorial, only one server will be managed.
For bigger setups, a naming scheme for client keys is recommended.

This tutorial was tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and OpenSSH 8.9.

**Prerequisites**

* Root access to the server
* `sshd` installed on a server
* `ssh` client installed on a client computer
* SSH key on a client computer
* `ssh-keygen` on both client and server (basically provided together with an `ssh` client)

**Example terminology**

* Client key: `id_ed25519` & `id_ed25519-cert.pub`
* CA key: `ca_user_key` & `ca_user_key.pub`

## Step 1 - Create an SSH Certificate Authority

This step consists of two substeps.
Both of them are performed on **server**.

### Step 1.1 - Create a New SSH Key Pair

We will use a separate key pair for CA.
This key pair is used for signing the user public keys only.

Create a new key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ca_user_key -t ed25519
```

> The key pair was saved in `~/.ssh`.

### Step 1.2 - Change SSH Server Settings

In order to keep the `sshd` configuration clean, we create an additional configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ca.conf`.
Put the following line into that file:

```text
TrustedUserCAKeys /root/.ssh/ca_user_key.pub
```

And also make sure that `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` has the following line:

```text
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

### Step 1.3 - Apply New Settings

Once you have changed `sshd` configuration, validate it with the following command:

```bash
sshd -t
```

This command shows nothing if the configuration is correct.
Otherwise, it shows an error message.

Now reload `sshd` configuration via systemctl:

```bash
systemctl reload sshd
```

## Step 2 - Sign the Client Key

Now the public SSH user key for the client needs to be signed.

We will store client keys in `~/.ssh/clients/` directory on **server**.
Create it with the following command:

```bash
mkdir -v ~/.ssh/clients/
```

After that, copy a client's public key into that directory.
Let's say you saved it in `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub` file.

For signing this key, use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen \
  -s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key \
  -I example_client \
  -n holu,root \
  -V +10h \
  ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* `-s ~/.ssh/ca_user_key` — Specify signing CA key.
* `-I example_client` — Key identifier for client's certificate.
* `-n holu,root` — Which usernames (comma separated list) the client can use to log in to the host.
* `-V +10h` — Validity of certificate, 10 hours starting from now (optional).
* `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub` — Path to the key to be singed.

If this was successful, you should find the client certificate at `~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

## Step 3 - Establish the Client Certificate on the Client Side

Now the client certificate must be copied to the client machine.

In this tutorial it is copied to `/home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub`.

It may be necessary to adjust the file permissions of the certificate.
This is possible with the following command:

```bash
chown -v client:client /home/client/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub
```

Now the client can connect to the server:

```bash
ssh -l holu <server address>
```

## Step 4 - Revoke Certificates Manually (optional)

We will use the Key Revocation List (KRL) file for revocation purposes.

To revoke certificates, you have to create a `revoked_keys` file and adjust the `sshd` configuration.

In this tutorial, the `revoked_keys` file is located in `/etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/`.
Create a directory and an empty file with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -v /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d
touch /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
```

Also, add the following line into `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ca.conf` file:

```text
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys
```

**The `sshd` configuration should be tested and activated as shown in [Step 1.3 - Apply New Settings](#step-13---apply-new-settings).**

To fill the KRL file with the **first** revoked certification, execute the following command.

```bash
ssh-keygen -k -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

* `-k` — Tells `ssh-keygen` that it works with KRL file format.
* `-f <path>` — Path to KRL file.
* `<path>` — Final argument is a public key to revoke.

To revoke **additional** certificates, add the `-u` argument, which means updating the KRL with the additional key.

```bash
ssh-keygen -k -u -f /etc/ssh/revoked_keys.d/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/clients/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Conclusion

The standard configuration is finished.
Now the client can log in to the host by using the certificate and the client SSH key.

To deploy this configuration setup automatically you can use Puppet or Ansible.
