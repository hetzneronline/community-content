## Introduction

A hardware security key is a great device for protecting your security online. They take the form of a small physical object, usually resembling a USB stick or dongle, and can be inserted in your computers USB port and tapped or pressed to authenticate to online services. The fact that the object is physical and works with advanced cryptography can dramatically increase your protection against remote attacks like phishing and MITM (Man in the middle) attacks.

FIDO2 and U2F (Universal 2 Factor) are two protocols that form the basis behind how your key authenticates with the web and other internet protocols.

In this tutorial we will be focusing on the support that OpenSSH has for these protocols, and getting it set up for you to authenticate to your server or cloud instance running Debian 10 (Stable).

To do this we'll need to **compile** and **build** the latest version (8.3 at time of writing) of OpenSSH from the next version of Debian (11/Bullseye) in a way that it will work nicely with Debian 10. It should behave fine since it is just a simple backport.

Keep in mind that building the software from source will mean that you won't receive updates for it via `apt` like the rest of your software. To keep up to date with security issues you should subscribe to Debian's [security mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) or an equivalent for your distribution.

Since this tutorial gets involved in the build process of Debian packages, it may seem a little complicated or involved at times. That said, these instructions are designed to be used by people of any skill level, and it's likely you'll learn something new along the way! :)

**Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial you will need:

- A server running Debian 10, either dedicated or virtual.
- A local Linux installation or Windows installation (With Ubuntu or Debian installed through Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - Arch Linux, Debian 10+ and Ubuntu 20.04+ are known to be compatible, anything else may work if it provides a version of OpenSSH 8.2 or later. macOS is untested.
- A U2F compatible hardware security key, for example a YubiKey or Solo Key.

This tutorial was tested on a fresh Hetzner Cloud CPX11 instance, though it should run perfectly fine on any other server.

## Step 1 - Preparing the system

If you've just provisioned the server you'll want to upgrade the installed packages and prepare the system for the package building.

### Step 1.1 - Upgrading and preparing the package repositories

You can upgrade your packages with:

```bash
root@<your_host>:~# apt update
root@<your_host>:~# apt upgrade
```

You will also need to add the `buster-backports` repository if it's not already present.  

Open `/etc/apt/sources.list` and check for the follow lines in the list. If either is not there, add them:

`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
```

You can then add the source repositories for Bullseye, the upcoming release of Debian which has the package we need. Please make sure you are **only** specifying `deb-src` here, and not `deb`.

`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```bash
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main
```

> Optionally if you're attempting this on a Hetzner server (Dedicated or cloud!), you can speed up the process of downloading these packages by adding an entry to download from the [Hetzner APT Mirror](https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Hetzner_Aptitude_Mirror/en):
>
> `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/hetzner-mirror.list`:
>
>    <!-- language: bash -->
>     deb http://mirror.hetzner.de/debian/packages buster main contrib non-free
>     deb http://mirror.hetzner.de/debian/packages buster-updates main contrib non-free
>     deb http://mirror.hetzner.de/debian/packages buster-backports main contrib non-free
>     deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main

After all these changes you'll need to run `apt update` one more time to download the package information.

You can verify you did it right by making sure both `buster-backports` and `bullseye` are mentioned in the output!

### Step 1.2 - Creating a sudo user

A quick note at this point is to create a user account if you haven't already, and allow them to access the root command through `sudo`.

For example:

```bash
root@<your_host>:~# adduser holu
Adding user `holu' ...
Adding new group `holu' (1001) ...
Adding new user `holu' (1001) with group `holu' ...
Creating home directory `/home/holu' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for holu
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: Hetzner Online Live User
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
root@<your_host>:~# usermod -aG sudo username
```

You can then login as that user with a fresh login shell like so:

```bash
root@<your_host>:~# sudo -i -u holu
holu@<your_host>:~$
```

And quickly check `sudo` is configured properly with the following command:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ sudo whoami
[sudo] password for holu:
root
holu@<your_host>:~$
```

## Step 2 - Installing development dependencies

First, we need to install the base Debian development dependencies:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts
```

There are 3 packages that we will need to build in order to successfully backport OpenSSH 8.3 to Buster. These are `libfido2`, `dh-runit` and of course `openssh`.

Of these, `libfido2` depends on a version of `cmake` that is not present in Debian 10 Buster. Thankfully it is provided in the `buster-backports` repository, and will need to be installed manually:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ sudo apt-get install -t buster-backports cmake
```

From here, we can now download the build dependencies for `libfido2` and `dh-runit`. We will be fetching the `openssh` build dependencies later, since it relies on these two.

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ sudo apt-get build-dep libfido2 dh-runit
```

That should be all the dependencies for now, we're ready to download the source code!

First, create a directory to store the code, then enter it:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ mkdir -p src/debian
holu@<your_host>:~$ cd src/debian
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$
```

And use the helpful function of `apt-get` to download the source code automatically!

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ apt-get source libfido2 dh-runit openssh
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ ls -1
dh-runit-2.8.15
dh-runit_2.8.15.dsc
dh-runit_2.8.15.tar.xz
libfido2-1.4.0
libfido2_1.4.0-2.debian.tar.xz
libfido2_1.4.0-2.dsc
libfido2_1.4.0.orig.tar.gz
libfido2_1.4.0.orig.tar.gz.asc
openssh-8.3p1
openssh_8.3p1-1.debian.tar.xz
openssh_8.3p1-1.dsc
openssh_8.3p1.orig.tar.gz
openssh_8.3p1.orig.tar.gz.asc
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$
```

That's all! Now we're ready for the build!

## Step 3 - Building the packages

Of these packages, `libfido2` should be installed first. Luckily it's quite a simple process.

First, enter the directory:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ cd libfido2-1.4.0/
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/libfido2-1.4.0$
```

(Make sure to replace the version number with the one you have downloaded. If you press the tab key after typing `libfido2-` it should autocomplete the correct folder.)

And then build!

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/libfido2-1.4.0$ debuild -b -uc -us
```

These parameters will build a binary only package (`.deb` file to install!), as well as instruct `debuild` to not sign the package, since it's only needed for personal use (and I'm assuming you trust yourself).

The build should complete relatively quickly on most systems. Once it's done, you'll want to install the needed packages:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/libfido2-1.4.0$ cd ..
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ sudo dpkg -i libfido2-1_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb fido2-tools_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb libfido2-dev_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb
```

Again, please make sure to replace the version numbers with the ones from your packages. Tab completion should help with that. Additionally, please make sure to **not** install packages with `dbgsym` in their name. These are for debugging purposes and are not needed for our purposes.

Next we can build the `dh-runit` package. The process should be the same as before:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ cd dh-runit-2.8.15/
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/dh-runit-2.8.15$ debuild -b -uc -us
```

And install:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/dh-runit-2.8.15$ cd ..
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ sudo dpkg -i dh-runit_2.8.15_all.deb runit-helper_2.8.15_all.deb
```

With that out of the way we have all the dependencies we need to get started with building OpenSSH!

Same as before, we'll need to install its build dependencies:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ sudo apt-get build-dep openssh
```

Build the source code:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ cd openssh-8.3p1/
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/openssh-8.3p1$ debuild -b -uc -us
```

(This build might take a little while if your server doesn't have enough processing resources. Don't worry though, it should proceed fine.)

And install the packages!

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian/openssh-8.3p1$ cd ..
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ sudo dpkg -i ssh_8.3p1-1_all.deb openssh-client_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb openssh-server_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb openssh-sftp-server_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb
```

At this point it may ask you if you want to replace your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file with a new one. This choice is up to you, I always personally keep the current configuration file since they're usually backwards and forwards compatible with each other.

Once you're done, check that it all worked!

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_8.3p1 Debian-1, OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019
```

If the output includes a version of `8.3` or higher, congratulations! You have successfully built a newer version of OpenSSH for Debian 10 Buster!

## Step 4 - Client setup

Next we will need to setup our client so that we can authenticate with our key!

### Step 4.1 - Installing a supported OpenSSH

#### Windows

If you're running Windows 10, install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and then go through the following Linux package install instructions. There will be special instructions in Step 4.2 for setting up WSL to work with your key.

Versions of Windows older than Windows 10 do not support U2F security keys in a compatible way.

#### Ubuntu 20.04 or higher

Ubuntu 20.04 or higher have support for OpenSSH 8.3 out of the box, so simply `sudo apt-get install openssh` if you haven't already! :)  

You should skip over the following Debian section if that worked, and rejoin at step 4.2!

#### Debian 10 Buster

If you're running Debian 10 Buster on your client side, you'll need to install a backported version of OpenSSH again!

Thankfully, you've already done that. You can copy the resulting `.deb` files and install them on your local machine.

First, put them in their own folder:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ mkdir debs
holu@<your_host>:~/src/debian$ mv *.deb debs/
```

(The `*` character acts as a wildcard, so in this case of `*.deb` it will move any file with a `.deb` file extension.)

Then, from your local machine, copy them locally.

If you logged into your server as root originally, you may need to use root for this operation. Alternatively, you can setup your regular user with your SSH keys. In the example I will be using root.

```bash
erisa@<your_local_machine>:~$ scp root@<203.0.113.1>:/home/holu/src/debian/debs .
```

(In this example, `erisa` is my local username on my computer. You'll also want to replace `<203.0.113.1>` with your server's IP address.)

In that command, `-r` will make it act recursively in order to download an entire directory, and `.` refers to the current directory on your local machine.

You can now install the packages from the `deb` folder you just downloaded locally:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ cd debs
erisa@<your_local_host>:~/debs$ sudo dpkg -i libfido2-1_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb fido2-tools_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb libfido2-dev_1.4.0-2_amd64.deb dh-runit_2.8.15_all.deb runit-helper_2.8.15_all.deb ssh_8.3p1-1_all.deb openssh-client_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb openssh-server_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb openssh-sftp-server_8.3p1-1_amd64.deb
```

This command is a bit of a big one. You may want to simplify it to `sudo dpkg -i *.deb` however be aware that will install a few undesired packages and dependencies on your local machine. They will not however cause any harm, just take up storage space for no real reason.

If you get an error like this one:

```bash
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of dh-runit:
 dh-runit depends on debhelper (>= 9); however:
  Package debhelper is not installed.
 dh-runit depends on libtext-hogan-perl; however:
  Package libtext-hogan-perl is not installed.
 dh-runit depends on libfile-slurp-perl; however:
  Package libfile-slurp-perl is not installed.
 dh-runit depends on libfile-copy-recursive-perl; however:
  Package libfile-copy-recursive-perl is not installed.

dpkg: error processing package dh-runit (--install):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
```

Don't worry! All you need to do is install some missing dependencies.

Simply run the following command:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~/debs$ sudo apt-get install -f
```

And `apt`will find and install the required dependencies for you.

Now all that's left is to do a simple version check:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~/debs$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_8.3p1 Debian-1, OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019
```

And you're done! Now for the fun part - getting the key to work with your new installations.

### Step 4.2 - Key generation and interop

Once you're all set up with the appropriate OpenSSH versions of both server and client, you're ready to generate your SSH key pair!

If you're running Windows, skip over these instructions to the section on Windows below.

#### **Linux**

The format we'll be using here is `ecdsa-sk`.

Issue the following command:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```

It should ask you to touch your security key, enter a PIN if one is set up and save the key. You can also add a local passphrase if you want to further protect your SSH connections!

Once you're done, you can find out the public key:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ cat .ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub
sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com AAAAInNrLWVjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTZAb3BlbnNzaC5jb20AAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBO5Uhm6IskKKlpu+waAlkZ79wE8hFBPpoPkEHb2V6sgCk+6UDbPCyU/siW6D4eHGMDzM4VVhvSkqrEpYa8samsQAAAAEc3NoOg== erisa@<your_local_host>
```

And add it to your server!

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ mkdir -p .ssh
holu@<your_host>:~$ echo '<your_public_key' >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

At this point you should be able to successfully authenticate with your server!

If it's using an old or different SSH key, supply `-i .ssh/id_ecdsa_sk` on the SSH commandline to use your security key instead.

#### **Windows**

If you're running Windows 10 with WSL, you'll need to setup your WSL instance to interact with your security key over the Windows U2F API.

To achieve this we'll be using a piece of open source software called [windows-fido-bridge](https://github.com/mgbowen/windows-fido-bridge).

You can check out the installation and usage instructions [on github](https://github.com/mgbowen/windows-fido-bridge#build-windows-fido-bridge-from-source).

Essentially it boils down to (at the time of writing)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 git libfmt-dev libgtest-dev

git clone https://github.com/mgbowen/windows-fido-bridge.git
cd windows-fido-bridge
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j $(nproc)
make test
sudo make install
```

On your local WSL instance.

You can then generate a keypair with:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/local/lib/libwindowsfidobridge.so ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```

Add it to your server with:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ cat .ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub
sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com AAAAInNrLWVjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTZAb3BlbnNzaC5jb20AAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBO5Uhm6IskKKlpu+waAlkZ79wE8hFBPpoPkEHb2V6sgCk+6UDbPCyU/siW6D4eHGMDzM4VVhvSkqrEpYa8samsQAAAAEc3NoOg== erisa@<your_local_host>
```

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ mkdir -p .ssh
holu@<your_host>:~$ echo '<your_public_key' >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

And connect to your server with:

```bash
erisa@<your_local_host>:~$ ssh -oSecurityKeyProvider=/usr/local/lib/libwindowsfidobridge.so remote-server
```

If you are going to be using the Security Key for all of your authentications, you can instead add the following to `.ssh/config` after creating a key pair:

```bash
Host *
        SecurityKeyProvider /usr/local/lib/libwindowsfidobridge.so
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
```

## Conclusion

Phew, that was a long ride! Hopefully you learnt something, and are now able to securely authenticate with your server using your hardware security key!

If in the future you need to update to a newer version of OpenSSH (Security patches, etc.) you can simply redownload the source code and run build/install commands by following the above instructions again!
