## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a fully automated, secure, and incremental backup system using BorgBackup on a separate Server. By the end, you will have a reliable system to protect your data.

It is best to rent this server from a different provider or have it at home. In any case, it should be at a different physical location.

**Prerequisites**

* 2 servers
* Access to the root user or a user with sudo permissions
* This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 24.04

## Step 1 - Prepare the Source Server

To start, configure the **Source server** that will be backed up:

1. Switch to the root user and create an SSH key:
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   cd && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. Install the required tools:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt install borgbackup ncdu -y
   ```

## Step 2 - Configure the Backup Server

Now, configure the **Backup Server** where backups will be stored:

1. Create a new user and install BorgBackup:
   ```bash
   sudo adduser serverbackup
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install borgbackup -y
   ```
   - **Important**: Do not give this user `sudo` privileges.

2. Set up SSH access:
   ```bash
   su serverbackup
   mkdir ~/.ssh
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   - Paste the public key from the source server (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) here.
   - Prepend the following command to the key:
     ```
     command="borg serve --restrict-to-path /home/serverbackup/backups --append-only"
     ```

3. Create a repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/backups/Server1
   borg init --encryption=repokey ~/backups/Server1
   ```

4. Export the repository key and store it securely:
   ```bash
   borg key export ~/backups/Server1 ~/key-export
   cat ~/key-export
   # Ensure you delete the key file from the server after storing it securely
   rm ~/key-export
   ```

## Step 3 - Automate Backups on the Source Server

Create and schedule automated backups on the **Source server**:

1. Create a backup script:
   ```bash
   nano ~/backup.sh
   ```

   **Content of `backup.sh`:**

   > Replace `<BACKUP_SERVER_IP>` and `YourSecurePassphrase` with your actual information.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
   REPOSITORY="ssh://serverbackup@<BACKUP_SERVER_IP>:22/~/backups/Server1"
   export BORG_PASSPHRASE="YourSecurePassphrase"

   echo "Starting backup..."

   borg create --exclude-caches $REPOSITORY::$DATE / \
       -e /dev -e /proc -e /sys -e /tmp -e /run -e /media -e /mnt -e /var/log

   echo "Pruning old backups..."

   borg prune -v $REPOSITORY \
       --keep-daily=14 \
       --keep-weekly=12 \
       --keep-monthly=24

   echo "Compacting repository to free space..."

   borg compact $REPOSITORY
   ```

2. Make the script executable and test it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/backup.sh
   ./backup.sh
   ```

3. Schedule the script to run daily:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line to schedule the backup at 2:00 AM:
   ```
   0 2 * * * /home/<user>/backup.sh
   ```

## Step 4 - Backup to Hetzner Storage Box (Optional)

To back up to a Hetzner Storage Box:

1. Copy your SSH key to the Hetzner server:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p 23 YourUsername@YourUsername.your-storagebox.de
   ```

2. Initialize a Borg repository on the Hetzner server:
   ```bash
   borg init --encryption=repokey ssh://YourUsername@YourUsername.your-storagebox.de:23/./Backup/SERVERNAME
   ```

3. Export and securely save the repository key:
   ```bash
   borg key export ssh://YourUsername@YourUsername.your-storagebox.de:23/./Backup/SERVERNAME ~/hetzner-key
   ```

---

**Notes:**
- Use a strong password WITHOUT special characters and save it safe!
- Save the repository key securely; both the key and passphrase are required to restore backups.

## Conclusion

You should now have daily backups of your server's root directory.
