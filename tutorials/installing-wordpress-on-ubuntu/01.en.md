## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to a self-hosted WordPress website on an Ubuntu server.

No complicated prerequisites are necessary, information presented in a self-contained manner.

Basic Linux knowledge is assumed.

**Prerequisites:**

* a new Ubuntu server with root access

* a domain pointing to your server (`A` DNS record created with an IP address of your server)
  * your DNS hosting provider should have a guide how to do that
  
  DNS record should be as follows, where `10.0.0.1` is an IP of your server.
  
  | Type | Name | Value    |
  | ---- | ---- | -------- |
  | A    | @    | 10.0.0.1 |

* SMTP ports (25 and 587) should not be blocked by your hosting provider. If they are blocked, try to find instructions to unblock them.

**Example terminology:**

These are just examples, replace them with your own values.

* Public IP address of your server: `10.0.0.1`

* Domain of your WordPress website: `example.com`

* New user that will be created on the server: `holu` 


## Step 1 - Configuring the server

### Step 1.1 - Checking DNS

To proceed you need to check that your domain points to the server. We will do it by using ping command.

Execute the following command on your **local computer** (replace `example.com` with your domain).

```bash
ping example.com
```

You will get the output similar to this:

```
PING example.com (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.017 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.035 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.065 ms

--- example.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2049ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.039/0.065/0.019 ms
```

In place of `10.0.0.1` you should see the IP address of your server.

If it's not the case, you will need to wait some time until DNS records will be updated.

In the meantime, you can follow the tutorial up to [**Step 3.4**](#step-34---configuring-https-support).

### Step 1.2 - Updating the system

You should update your system.

1. Check for updates:

    ```bash
    apt update
    ```

2. Perform the update, press **y** to agree with updates if necessary.

    ```bash
    apt upgrade
    ```

### Step 1.3 - Creating a user

You should create a regular system user to use with your WordPress instance.
Replace `holu` with a desired username.

```bash
adduser holu
```

You will be prompted for a password. Everything else can be skipped by pressing **Enter**.

> **Note!**
>
> It's recommended to use an SSH key for authentication instead of a password.
> Follow the [Setting up an SSH key](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) tutorial to learn how to do it.

Now you need to add the user to the sudo group, to be able to run commands with the superuser privileges.

```bash
usermod -aG sudo holu
```

> **Note!**
>
> You can optionally change the two configuration options. First the root user can be disabled. After you have added the new user to the sudo group, you can use it to connect to your server over SSH and perform administrative tasks. Second if you have configured an SSH key for the new user, you can disable password authentication in the OpenSSH server. How to change both configuration options is explained [here](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-initial-setup-ubuntu#step-7---deactivating-root-login).

From now on we will use the newly created user, run the following command:

* replace `holu` with your username.

```bash
su holu
```

Your shell prompt will be changed to something like:

```shellsession
holu@ubuntu:~$
```

You can prefix your commands with `sudo` to run them as a root user. You will be asked for your password that is chosen in the `adduser` command above.

### Step 1.4 - Configuring a time zone

You need to change the server time zone to your time zone. The web server logs will be written using this time zone.

To do that use the command:

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Use **Up** and **Down** arrows to navigate and **Enter** to make a choice.

### Step 1.5 - Creating a directory for WordPress

We need to create the directory where the WordPress website will be installed, for example:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/wordpress
```

Give the permissions to the regular user:

* replace `holu` with your username

```bash
sudo chown holu:holu /var/www/wordpress
```

## Step 2 - Installing required software

### Step 2.1 - Using a package manager

Before we can proceed with WordPress installation, we need to install the required software packages.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx mariadb-server mariadb-client \
php-fpm php-cli php-zip php-xml php-mysql php-json php-curl php-imagick \
certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Here is a short description of each package and why it's required.

| Package(s)       | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------|
| `nginx`          | The web server that accepts HTTP requests from a browser. |
| `mariadb-server` | The database server, used to store and query the WordPress database. |
| `mariadb-client` | The database client which is used to connect to the database server from the command line. |
| `php-fpm`        | The `nginx` web server will pass php files to FPM for execution. It will run WordPress core, themes and plugins. |
| `php-cli`        | The PHP interpreter which is used to execute PHP scripts from the command line. Used to run WP-CLI utility which is described below. |
| `zip, xml, mysql,json, curl, imagick` | The PHP extensions which are required to run WordPress. |
| `certbot, python3-certbot-nginx` | Packages for HTTPS support. |

### Step 2.2 - Checking the PHP version installed

We will need the PHP version in the future steps. Run the command:

```bash
php -v
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
PHP 7.4.3 (cli) (built: Oct  6 2020 15:47:56) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.4.3, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
```

only the first two numbers relevant here (major and minor version), `7.4` in my case.

### Step 2.3 - Installing WP-CLI

WP-CLI provides many useful functions to work with WordPress from command line.

1. You need to execute the following commands to install WP-CLI:

    ```bash
    cd
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar
    sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
    ```

2. The `wp` command is now available in the shell.

3. WP-CLI can be updated by repeating step 1 if necessary.

## Step 3 - Configuring required software

### Step 3.1 - Configuring PHP

1. Open the configuration file with a text editor, replace `7.4` with your PHP version from [**Step 2.2**](#step-22---checking-the-php-version-installed):

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
    ```

2. Find these lines:

    ```ini
    user = www-data
    group = www-data
    ```

3. Replace `www-data` with the username from [**Step 1.3**](#step-13---creating-a-user):

    ```ini
    user = holu
    group = holu 
    ```

4. Press **Ctrl+S** to save and **Ctrl+X** to exit

5. We need to reload the configuration file to apply our changes, replace `7.4` with your PHP version.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop php7.4-fpm
    sudo systemctl start php7.4-fpm
    ```

### Step 3.2 - Configuring nginx

1. Create the configuration file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
    ```

2. Paste this content:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;
        root /var/www/wordpress;
        index index.php;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }
    }
    ```

3. Edit the content:

    * replace `example.com` with your domain
    * replace `/var/www/wordpress` with the directory created in [**Step 1.5**](#step-15---creating-a-directory-for-wordpress)
    * on a line `fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;` replace `7.4` with your PHP version

4. Save the file and close it

5. Enable the configuration file:

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress \
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/wordpress
    ```

6. Reload:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```

### Step 3.3 - Configuring MariaDB

1. Type `sudo mysql` to open the database shell as a root user.

2. Create the database account for the system user, replace `holu` with your username from [**Step 1.3**](#step-13---creating-a-user).

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'holu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED VIA unix_socket;
    ```

3. You need to choose the database name for your WordPress website. Let's use `wordpress_db` as an example.
    The user created in the previous step needs permissions to work with a database, the database will be created later on in [**Step 4**](#step-4---installing-wordpress):

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL ON wordpress_db.* TO 'holu'@'localhost';
    ```

4. Type `\q` to close the shell.

If you want to work with your database, open it in the `mysql` shell with `mysql wordpress_db`, without `sudo` prefix.

### Step 3.4 - Configuring HTTPS support

1. Execute the following command, replace `example.com` with your domain:

    ```bash
    sudo certbot -d example.com
    ```

2. Provide your email and agree with terms of service

3. When prompted to redirect requests or not you should type **2** to redirect them and press **Enter**.

### Step 3.5 - Configuring the email notifications

You need to install and configure the mail server to receive the email notifications from your WordPress website.

**Prerequisites:**

* You need to create the following DNS record for your WordPress domain.

  | Type | Name | Value         |
  | ---- | ---- | ------------- |
  | TXT  | @    | v=spf1 a -all |

  This basically says that only the server where your WordPress website is hosted is allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain. Many popular email services will reject emails without this configuration. 

To install the `postfix` mail server run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install postfix
```

You will be asked to choose the mail server configuration, use arrows to select "Internet Site" and press **Enter**.

On the next screen you need to configure the "mail name". Use the domain name of your WordPress website for which you have configured the `TXT` record above.

Now you need to edit the `postfix` configuration file. Open it in the text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

Make the following adjustments:

* Change `inet_protocols` configuration option to `inet_protocols = ipv4`.

  This is needed because Gmail will reject the emails if you send them over IPv6.

* Change `inet_interfaces` configuration option to `inet_interfaces = loopback-only`.

  This will disable incoming emails. WordPress website needs only outgoing emails to be working to send you notifications.

* Change `myhostname` configuration option to `myhostname = example.com`.

  Where `example.com` is a domain of your WordPress website for which you have configured the `TXT` record above.

Save the file and restart `postfix`:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postfix
sudo systemctl start postfix
```

If you have problems with receiving emails from your website, try to take a look at the `/var/log/mail.log` log file. Additionally take a look in your email spam folder.

## Step 4 - Installing WordPress

1. Change the current working directory to the WordPress directory, created in [**Step 1.5**](#step-15---creating-a-directory-for-wordpress):

    ```bash
    cd /var/www/wordpress
    ```

2. Download WordPress:

    ```bash
    wp core download
    ```

3. This command will create the `wp-config.php` file where the WordPress configuration is stored.

   * replace `wordpress_db` with a database name from [**Step 3.3**](#step-33---configuring-mariadb)
   * replace `holu` with the user created in [**Step 1.3**](#step-13---creating-a-user)

    ```bash
    wp config create --dbname=wordpress_db --dbuser=holu --prompt=
    ```

4. Create the database:

    ```bash
    wp db create
    ```

5. Install WordPress:

    * replace `example.com` with your domain
    * replace `holu` with a desired **WordPress username**, this can be different from your system username
    * replace `holu@example.com` with your email

    ```bash
    wp core install --url=https://example.com --title="WordPress Blog" \
    --admin_user=holu --admin_email=holu@example.com
    ```

6. WP-CLI will generate and output your WordPress password to the terminal. Additionally, you will receive email notification that a new WordPress website has been created.

7. Go to `https://example.com/wp-admin` to log in to your WordPress website.

8. Finally you should see the WordPress Admin Dashboard:
