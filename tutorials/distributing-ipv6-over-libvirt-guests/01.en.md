## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to distribute part of your pool of IPv6 addresses to your libvirt guests using bridges. This way, they will all have their own public IPv6.

**Prerequisites**

First of all, you need a dedicated server with `libvirt` installed as well as a `/64` IPv6 subnet. This comes with most dedicated servers anyway.
I will assume that your machine runs something like Debian, but it should be applicable to most other distros too.

What should you know before we start:

* Your IPv6 subnet address (in this tutorial we'll be using `2001:db8:5678` as an example)

## Step 1 - Install required packages

The only package you will need besides your existing libvirt installation is the `bridge-utils` and the `ifupdown` package:

```
sudo apt install bridge-utils ifupdown
```

## Step 2 - Create the bridge interface

The next step is to create the bridge interface using the packages we just installed:

```
sudo brctl addbr br0
```

### Step 2.1 - Assign a subnet

Next, we will assign a `/96` subnet to the bridge. This should be enough; it is very unlikely that your dedicated server can run enough VMs to run out of addresses here.

```
sudo ip addr add <your /64 subnet>:1:0:0:1/96 dev br0
```

Example:

```
sudo ip addr add 2001:db8:5678:1:0:0:1/96 dev br0
```

### Step 2.2 - Set it up

Now we can set it up (or: "enable it")

```
ip link set br0 up
```

## Step 3 - Add the interface to a VM

We will now attach this bridge to a VM. To do that, run

```
sudo virsh
```

And enter:

```
edit --domain <name of the VM>
```

Now add the following entry to the `devices` node:

```
<interface type='bridge'>
  <source bridge='br0'/>
  <model type='virtio'/>
  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x07' slot='0x00' function='0x0'/>
</interface>
```

*Please note that the address depends on the total number of devices attached to the guest.*

The interface should be hot-plugged to your VM now, so it's not going to require a reboot.

## Step 4 - Set up your VM

You now need to set up the new network interface with the following static configuration:

```
auto enp7s0
iface enp7s0 inet6 static
  address <your /64 subnet>:1::<machine suffix>
  netmask 96
  gateway <your /64 subnet>:1::1
```

Example:

```
auto enp7s0
iface enp7s0 inet6 static
  address 2001:db8:5678:1::dead
  netmask 96
  gateway 2001:db8:5678:1::1
  ```

To do this on a Linux guest, just append these lines to your `/etc/network/interfaces` file. On a Windows guest, you will have to fill it in the Windows Settings app.

*Tip:* on Ubuntu, you might have to use netplan instead

### Step 4.1 - Activate the config

The final step is to activate the config by restarting the `networking` service:

```
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

Your networking should be back up after just a few seconds. It will not interrupt your SSH session.

## Conclusion

You can now SSH into your machine using the static address you filled in! Now, you could make your bridge configuration persistent by adding it to your hosts `/etc/network/interfaces` file, and you could install a DHCP server to automatically assign addresses.
