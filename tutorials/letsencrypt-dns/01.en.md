## Introduction

In order to help users encrypt traffic to your server, you need a valid TLS/SSL certificate. Let's Encrypt is an organization which issues such certificates for free. However, you have to prove ownership over the domain, for which you want the certificate. This tutorial guides you through getting a wildcard certificate for your domain, while using the [Hetzner DNS service](https://docs.hetzner.com/networking/dns/getting-started/creating-a-zone) in Hetzner Console and [its API](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/reference/cloud#dns).

With Let's Encrypt, there are different types of challenges to prove that you own the domain (see "[Challenge Types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/))". This tutorial uses the DNS-01 challenge, which requires you to create a new DNS entry called `_acme-challenge.example.com`. You could create this DNS entry manually. However, we will use scripts that automatically create and delete the DNS entry for us.

The route this tutorial takes is one of many.

**Prerequisites**

You need the following things to get started:

* A server
* A domain: `<example.com>`
* Your Domain is set up to use the Hetzner DNS service in Hetzner Console
  > Not covered here, but if you have your domain with another provider, you can follow the first two steps in [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/configure-lb-cert-with-external-domain).

This tutorial assumes you are using Ubuntu 24.04, however this should also work on other Linux systems.

## Step 1 - Install Dependencies

We will make use of curl, jq and certbot. You need to install those:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl jq certbot
```

Additionally we also need some glue between certbot and Hetzner's API:

* `/usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh`
  
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  
  token="$(cat /etc/hetzner-dns-token)"
  
  domain_name="$( echo $CERTBOT_DOMAIN | rev | cut -d'.' -f 1,2 | rev)"
  subdomain=".${CERTBOT_DOMAIN%.$domain_name}"
  if [ "$CERTBOT_DOMAIN" = "$domain_name" ]; then
    subdomain=""
  fi
  
  # Create TXT record for DNS-01 challenge
  curl "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/zones/${domain_name}/rrsets" \
    -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"name\": \"_acme-challenge${subdomain}\",
      \"type\": \"TXT\",
      \"ttl\":300,
      \"records\":[{\"value\":\"\\\"${CERTBOT_VALIDATION}\\\"\"}] }" > /dev/null 2>/dev/null
  
  # just make sure we sleep for a while (this should be a dig poll loop)
  sleep 30
  ```

<br>

* `/usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh`
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  
  token="$(cat /etc/hetzner-dns-token)"
  
  domain_name="$( echo $CERTBOT_DOMAIN | rev | cut -d'.' -f 1,2 | rev)"
  subdomain=".${CERTBOT_DOMAIN%.$domain_name}"
  if [ "$CERTBOT_DOMAIN" = "$domain_name" ]; then
    subdomain=""
  fi
  
  curl "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/zones/${domain_name}/rrsets/_acme-challenge${subdomain}/TXT" \
    -X "DELETE" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
  ```

<br>

Set the correct permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh
```

If your domain uses a standard single-level structure, like `example.com`, you can now proceed to step 2.

If your domain includes a second-level designation, like `example.co.uk`, update the value of `domain_name` at the beginning of both files from `1,2` to `1,2,3`:

```bash
sudo sed -i "s/-f 1,2 /-f 1,2,3 /" /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh
sudo sed -i "s/-f 1,2 /-f 1,2,3 /" /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh
```

## Step 2 - Acquire API Token

In order to talk to the Hetzner API, we need an authorization token with "Read & Write" permissions. You can create one in Hetzner Console:

[Getting Started » Generating an API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token)

For this tutorial, we will assume the token is:

```plaintext
LlGoDUQ39S6akqoav5meAsv5OIpeywhj
```

Save the token to `/etc/hetzner-dns-token`:

```bash
echo "LlGoDUQ39S6akqoav5meAsv5OIpeywhj" | sudo tee /etc/hetzner-dns-token > /dev/null
```

## Step 3 - Get Certificate

At this point, we can request a certificate from Let's Encrypt:

> Replace `<example.com>` with your own domain.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --manual-auth-hook /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh --manual-cleanup-hook /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh -d <example.com> -d *.<example.com>
```

## Step 4 - Install Certificate

After having acquired a freshly baked TLS/SSL certificate, you will also want to put it to use. For example in a web server, or a mail server. This however is not covered here.

## Conclusion

We created a Hetzner Console API token and used domain validation to request a wildcard certificate, which covers the domain, as well as all subdomains.
