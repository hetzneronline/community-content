## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to connect the Hetzner DNS Management to a Plesk Server using Bind and AXFR for zone transfer.

If the Plesk installation was done via Hetzner's robot administration interface, it is very likely, that this configuration has already been applied.

## Step 1 - Make changes in Plesk

First, you have to allow the zone transfer to the Hetzner DNS servers and adjust your DNS template on the Plesk server.

To do so, log into your Plesk server and go to "Tools & Settings", "General Settings" ➔ "DNS Settings".

There, you need to click on the tab "Transfer Restrictions Template" and add the following IPs:

* `213.239.242.238` # ns1.first-ns.de
* `213.133.100.103` # robotns2.second-ns.de (new)
* `213.133.105.6`   # robotns2.second-ns.de (old)
* `193.47.99.3`     # robotns3.second-ns.com

If you like to use IPv6 for zone transfer, you also should add the following IPs:

* `2a01:4f8:0:a101::a:1`  # ns1.first-ns.de
* `2a01:4f8:0:1::5ddc:2`  # robotns2.second-ns.de (new)
* `2a01:4f8:d0a:2004::2`  # robotns2.second-ns.de (old)
* `2001:67c:192c::add:a3` # robotns3.second-ns.com

![Add IPs](images/plesk-ips.jpg)

After doing so, you need to go back to the tab "Zone Records Template" under "Tools & Settings", "General Settings" ➔ "DNS Settings".

Here, you have to click on "Add Record".

As Record Type, you have to select "NS" and as nameserver, you have to enter the 3 nameservers of Hetzner:

* ns1.first-ns.de
* robotns2.second-ns.de
* robotns3.second-ns.com

![Add nameservers](images/plesk-nameservers.jpg)

When returning  to the main overview, make sure that you delete the 2 default NS Records. After doing so, click on "Apply the changes to all hosted domains".

Next, you need to go to the tab "Zone Settings Template" under "Tools & Settings", "General Settings" ➔ "DNS Settings".

Make sure "Use the serial number format recommended by IETF and RIPE" is checked so that DNS replication works.

## Step 2 - Add the domain to Hetzner

Sign into the [Hetzner DNS Console](https://dns.hetzner.com/).

Click on "Add new zone", type in your domain, choose "Secondary" and click on "Continue".

![Add Zone](images/hetzner-dns-zone.jpg)

On the next page, select your Plesk Server in the given dropdown and confirm with "Add server" and "Continue". After this, you should be able to see that the domain was added successfully.

## Step 3 - Update your Domain

If your domain is already registered and you are using it on different nameservers, you need to update your domain at your registrar.

I highly recommend you first check that the Hetzner nameservers are answering correctly. You can check this by querying them:

```dig
> dig @ns1.first-ns.de example.com -t NS

> dig @robotns2.second-ns.de example.com -t NS

> dig @robotns3.second-ns.com example.com -t NS
```

In all 3 cases, you should see the NS records with the nameservers of Hetzner.

```console
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.     86400   IN      NS      ns1.first-ns.de.
example.com.     86400   IN      NS      robotns2.second-ns.de.
example.com.     86400   IN      NS      robotns3.second-ns.com.
```

After you are certain all data is correct, you can update your domain at your registrar and point them to the 3 Hetzner nameservers ns1.first-ns.de, robotns2.second-ns.de and robotns3.second-ns.com.

## Conclusion

You've now connected the Hetzner DNS Management to a Plesk Server.
