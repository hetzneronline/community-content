## Introduction

With Hetzner recently launching its new DNS Console, it’s the right moment to describe how to connect the Hetzner DNS Management to a Plesk Server using Bind and AXFR for zone transfer.

## Step 1 - Make changes in Plesk

First, you have to allow the zone transfer to the Hetzner DNS servers and adjust your DNS template on the Plesk server.

To do so, log into your Plesk server and go to "Tools & Settings", "General Settings", "DNS Template".

![DNS Template](images/DNS.png)

There you need to click on "Transfer Restrictions Template" and add the following 3 IPs:

* 193.47.99.3
* 213.133.105.6
* 213.239.242.238

After doing so, you need to again go to "Tools & Settings", "General Settings", "DNS Template".

Here, you have to click on "Add DNS Record".

As Record Type you have to select "NS" and as nameserver, you have to enter the 3 nameservers of hetzner:

* helium.ns.hetzner.de
* hydrogen.ns.hetzner.com
* oxygen.ns.hetzner.com

When returning  to the main overview, make sure that you delete the 2 default NS Records. After doing so, click on "Apply the changes to all hosted domains".

## Step 2 - Add the domain to Hetzner

Sign into the [Hetzner DNS Console](https://dns.hetzner.com/).

Click on "Add new zone", type in your domain, choose "Secondary" and click on "Continue".

On the next page, select your Plesk Server in the given dropdown and confirm with "Add server" and "Continue". After this, you should be able to see that the domain was added successfully.

## Step 3 - Update your Domain

If your domain is already registered and you are using it on different nameservers, you need to update your domain at your registrar.

I highly recommend you first check that the Hetzner nameservers are answering correctly. You can check this by querying them:

```dig
> dig @oxygen.ns.hetzner.com mygreathosting.com -t NS

> dig @helium.ns.hetzner.de mygreathosting.com -t NS

> dig @hydrogen.ns.hetzner.com mygreathosting.com -t NS
```

In all 3 cases, you should see the NS records with the nameservers of Hetzner.

```console
;; ANSWER SECTION:
mygreathosting.com.     86400   IN      NS      hydrogen.ns.hetzner.com.
mygreathosting.com.     86400   IN      NS      helium.ns.hetzner.de.
mygreathosting.com.     86400   IN      NS      oxygen.ns.hetzner.com.
```

After you are certain all data is correct, you can update your domain at your registrar and point them to the 3 Hetzner nameservers oxygen, helium and hydrogen.

## Conclusion

You've now connected the Hetzner DNS Management to a Plesk Server.
