## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to successfully deploy an `.img` file on a cloud server using the rescue system.  
This process is required when installing a custom operating system image on the server.

**Prerequisites**

- A cloud server
  - Activated rescue system
  - SSH access to the server
- A volume to temporarily store the `.img` file (as the primary disk will be overwritten)
- An operating system `.img` file (or `.qcow2`, see step 3)
- Basic Linux command-line skills

## Step 1 - Activating and Connecting to the Rescue System

* **Activating the Rescue System**
  
  1. Log in to the **cloud provider's management console**.
  2. Select the target server and activate the **rescue system**.
  3. If required, add an **SSH key** for easier authentication.
  4. Reboot the server to enter rescue mode.

<br>

* **Connecting to the Server**
  
  Make an SSH connection to the rescue system:
  
  ```bash
  ssh root@<your_server_ip>
  ```
  
  After logging in, the rescue system banner will appear.

## Step 2 - Identifying the Target Disk and Mounting the Volume

Since the `.img` file cannot be stored directly on the primary disk, a **volume** is required as a storage location.  
To list all available volumes, use the following command:

```bash
lsblk
```

Example output:

```
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda       8:0    0  76G  0 disk 
sdb       8:16   0  40G  0 disk 
```

Here, `sda` is the **primary disk** to be overwritten, while `sdb` is the **volume** to store the `.img` file.

### Manually Mounting the Volume

In the **rescue system**, additional **volumes are not mounted automatically**.  
Now create a **mount directory** and mount the volume:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/vol1
mount /dev/sdX /mnt/vol1
```

*Replace `/dev/sdX` with the actual volume name (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).*

If you are unsure which volume to use, check the partition table:

```bash
fdisk -l
```

## Step 3 - Preparing the Image File

If the uploaded or downloaded image is in `.qcow2` format, it needs to be converted:

```bash
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw /mnt/vol1/source.qcow2 /mnt/vol1/destination.img
```

With an image in `.img` format, you can choose from three methods:

* **Method 1:** Upload via SCP (Command Line)
  
  If the `.img` file is stored locally, it can be uploaded using **SCP**:
  
  ```bash
  scp /path/to/image.img root@<your_server_ip>:/mnt/vol1/
  ```

<br>

* **Method 2:** Upload via SFTP (FileZilla)
  
  For users who prefer a graphical interface, **FileZilla** can be used:
  
  1. Open **FileZilla**.
  2. **Create a new connection:**
     
     | Option              | Value              |
     | ------------------- | ------------------ |
     | **Server**          | `<your_server_ip>` |
     | **Username**        | root               |
     | **Passwort**        | `<your_password>`  |
     | **Port**            | 22                 |
     | **Connection Type** | SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol |
  
  3. Drag and drop the `.img` file into the `/mnt/vol1/` directory.

<br>

* **Method 3:** Download using `wget`
  
  If the `.img` file is hosted externally, it can be downloaded directly to the server:
  
  ```bash
  wget <URL_to_image.img> -O /mnt/vol1/image.img
  ```

## Step 4 - Writing the Image to the Target Disk

* **Recommended Method: `pv | dd`**
  
  Now, `pv | dd` is used for better visibility of progress:
  
  ```bash
  pv /mnt/vol1/image.img | dd of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
  ```
  
  If `pv` is not installed, it can be added with:
  
  ```bash
  apt update && apt install -y pv
  ```

<br>

* **Alternative: `dd` Directly**
  
  If `pv` is not used, the image can be written directly with `dd`:
  
  ```bash
  dd if=/mnt/vol1/image.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
  ```

## Step 5 - Reboot and Check the System

Once the image has been successfully written, the server can be rebooted.

Use the following command to reboot into the installed operating system:

```bash
reboot
```

After the reboot, verify that the system has booted successfully and is accessible.

### Troubleshooting Boot Problems
If the system does not boot correctly, consult the operating system documentation.  
In some cases, a bootloader check may be required.

For general bootloader configuration, see:
- **GNU GRUB - Official Documentation:**  
  [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html)

- **UEFI Specification and Documentation:**  
  [https://uefi.org/specifications](https://uefi.org/specifications)

## Note on Alternative Image Formats
Some alternative image formats can also be converted and used.  
However, there is a risk that they may not work properly due to driver or hardware compatibility issues.  

**Cloud servers are based on KVM virtualization**, so ensure that the operating system you choose is KVM-compatible.

## Conclusion

The custom operating system should now be installed on the server.
