## Introduction

We are focusing on installing the Cloud Hosted Router (CHR) OS and doing a basic setup in this documentation. For any further configuration details, please take a look at the official [MikroTik wiki](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Main_Page).

**Prerequisites**

Make sure the cloud server meets the requirements for your desires. This setup can be performed on any available cloud server.

## Step 1 - Installation

If you have not already done so, create a server of your choice. Then boot it into the `rescue` system. The login credentials are shown while requesting it. To install CHR we download the `Raw disk image` from the [MikroTik website](https://mikrotik.com/download#chr) and extract it directly onto the virtual disk via DD.

These commands do all the necessary steps:

```
# curl -L https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/6.47.9/chr-6.47.9.img.zip > mikrotik-chr.zip
# funzip mikrotik-chr.zip > mikrotik-chr.img
# dd if=/path/to/mikrotik-chr.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M
```

## Step 2 -  Security

Afterwards you can reboot the server into the newly installed OS.

Keep in mind, that the default login credentials are `user : admin` and `password : none`. Therefore it is recommended to immediately disable the admin user and add a new one. To do so, login to your server via ssh or the Hetzner Console and do the following commands:

```
# /user add name=<username> password=<userpassword> group=full
# /user remove admin
```

If desired you can add an IP address to a user, limiting access to that user account from the IP entered.

```
# /user set <username> allowed-address=<IPv4>/<Netmask>
```

Now we want to disable all unnecessary services. Current running services can be shown via `# /ip service print`.  In this case we will disable all except `ssh`:

```
# /ip service disable telnet,ftp,www,api,api-ssl,winbox
``` 

We recommend to change the `default ssh port 22` with any other desired port.

```
# /ip service set ssh port=33458
```

The following commands disable unwanted management access to network devices, which we recommend.

```
# /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=none
# /tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=none
# /tool mac-server ping set enabled=no
# /tool bandwidth-server set enabled=no
# /ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=none 
# /ip dns set allow-remote-requests=no
# /ip proxy set enabled=no
# /ip socks set enabled=no
# /ip upnp set enabled=no
# /ip cloud set ddns-enabled=no update-time=no
# /ip ssh set strong-crypto=yes
```

## Step 3 - Basic Firewall

Right from the start the CHR has a basic firewall setup and we strongly recommend to not turn it off, if you are not 100% sure what to do. The following rules adjust it to make it more secure:

```
# /ip firewall filter
# add action=accept chain=input connection-state=established,related # accept established/related connections 
# add action=accept chain=input src-address-list=<list-name> # IPs in <list-name> are allowed to access 
# add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp # allows ICMP
# add action=drop chain=input # Other connections getting dropped
# /ip firewall address-list
# add address=10.0.0.1-10.0.0.254 list=<list-name> # adds addresses to <list-name>
```

We will now create some basic adjustments to the firewall rules for the clients.

First add the desired private networks to a list:

```
# /ip firewall address-list
# add address=10.0.0.0/24 list=private_networks
# add address=10.0.1.0/24 list=private_networks
...
```

Now we want to secure those networks.

First packets with `connection-state=established,related` are added to [FastTrack](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/Fasttrack) and only new connections will be allowed by the firewall. Next we will also set a rule to drop any invalid connection. Those are logged with the tag `invalid`.

The same is done for private IPs, which try to reach a public IP. To make sure that non-public addresses from outside cannot reach your server, we drop those packages, as well as packages from the LAN with non-private IPs.

``` 
# /ip firewall filter
# add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related
# add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
# add action=drop chain=forward connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=invalid
# add action=drop chain=forward dst-address-list=not_in_internet in-interface=bridge1 log=yes log-prefix=!public_from_LAN out-interface=!bridge1
# add action=drop chain=forward connection-nat-state=!dstnat connection-state=new in-interface=ether1 log=yes log-prefix=!NAT
# add action=drop chain=forward in-interface=ether1 log=yes log-prefix=!public src-address-list=private_networks
# add action=drop chain=forward in-interface=bridge1 log=yes log-prefix=LAN_!LAN src-address=!<privateIP-network>
```

## Conclusion

After you have followed all steps correctly, you should have a stable basic setup of the MikroTik Cloud Hosted Router OS.
