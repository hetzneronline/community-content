## Introduction

To establish a secure connection between hosts IPSec is often used. During installation, one must remember that CX vServers translate the public IP via 1:1 NAT to an internal IP.

This tutorial uses StrongSWAN and Pre-shared-keys to establish a transparent IPSec connection between an external host and a CX vServer. The public IPs can then be used on both sides.

This procedure should also work on cloud servers.

## Data

### Host Alice (Endpoint Host A)

* System: Debian 8 jessie
* IPSec: strongswan 5.2.1-6+deb8u2
* IPv4: 192.0.2.10
* IPv6: 2001:db8:61:20e1::2

### Host Bob (Endpoint CX vServer)

* System: Debian 8 jessie
* IPSec: strongswan 5.2.1-6+deb8u2
* IPv4: 203.0.113.40
* IPv4 intern: 172.31.1.100
* IPv6: 2a01:4f8:db8:c17::2

## Installation

We build two tunnels, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

### Alice

Installing packages:

```console
# apt-get install strongswan
# ipsec stop
```

Creating/Modifying the `/etc/ipsec.conf` file with the correct values:

```text
version 2.0
#
config setup
#
conn NameDerVerbindung
        type=transport
        keyingtries=0
        authby=secret
        auto=start
        leftid=192.0.2.10
        left=192.0.2.10
        rightid=203.0.113.40
        right=203.0.113.40
#
conn NameDerVerbindungSix
        type=transport
        keyingtries=0
        authby=secret
        auto=start
        leftid=2001:db8:61:20e1::2
        left=2001:db8:61:20e1::2
        rightid=2001:db8:c17::2
        right=2001:db8:c17::2
```

Some StrongSwan Versions use specific insertions. In our case they are exactly 8 Spaces or one tab.

Creating/Modifying the `/etc/ipsec.secrets` file with the correct values:

```text
203.0.113.40 192.0.2.10 : PSK "SuperGeheimesPasswortFuerIp4Tunnel"
2001:db8:c17::2 2001:db8:61:20e1::2 : PSK "SuperGeheimesPasswortFuerIp6Tunnel"
```

Starting the IPSec-Tunnel:

```console
# ipsec start
```

### Bob

Installing Packages:

```console
# apt-get install strongswan
# ipsec stop
```

Creating/Modifying the `/etc/ipsec.conf` file with the correct values:

```text
version 2.0
#
config setup
#
conn NameDerVerbindung
        type=transport
        keyingtries=0
        authby=secret
        auto=start
        leftid=203.0.113.40
        left=172.31.1.100
        rightid=192.0.2.10
        right=192.0.2.10
#
conn NameDerVerbindungSix
        type=transport
        keyingtries=0
        authby=secret
        auto=start
        leftid=2001:db8:c17::2
        left=2001:db8:c17::2
        rightid=2001:db8:61:20e1::2
        right=2001:db8:61:20e1::2
```

Creating/Modifying the `/etc/ipsec.secrets` file with the correct values:

```text
192.0.2.10 203.0.113.40 : PSK "SuperSecretPasswordForIp4Tunnel"
2001:db8:61:20e1::2 2001:db8:c17::2 : PSK "SuperSecretPasswordForIp6Tunnel"
```

Starting the IPSec-Tunnel:

```console
# ipsec start
```

## Test

The tunnels should have been created successfully. You can check it in `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/auth.log`.

The command `ipsec status` should show something like this:

```text
Security Associations (2 up, 0 connecting):
  TemplateTwo[20]: ESTABLISHED 76 minutes ago, 172.31.1.100[203.0.113.40]...192.0.2.10[192.0.2.10]
  TemplateTwo{12}:  INSTALLED, TRANSPORT, ESP in UDP SPIs: c5b8b7f7_i ccf37767_o
  TemplateTwo{12}:   172.31.1.100/32 === 192.0.2.10/32
  TemplateTwoSix[19]: ESTABLISHED 82 minutes ago, 2001:db8:c17::2[2001:db8:c17::2]...2001:db8:61:20e1::2[2001:db8:61:20e1::2]
  TemplateTwoSix{11}:  INSTALLED, TRANSPORT, ESP SPIs: c5521750_i cbe50d53_o
  TemplateTwoSix{11}:   2001:db8:c17::2/128 === 2001:db8:61:20e1::2/128
```

You should be able to see the ESP Packages via `tcpdump` (simple Ping):

```text
13:42:53.000336 IP 203.0.113.40.ipsec-nat-t > 192.0.2.10.ipsec-nat-t: UDP-encap: ESP(spi=0xccf37767,seq=0x516), length 116
```

## Conclusion

By now you should be able to install an IPSec Connection on a virtual server with NAT.
