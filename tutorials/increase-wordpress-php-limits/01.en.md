## Introduction

If your WordPress site fails during plugin installs, media uploads, imports, or bulk updates, you are often hitting resource ceilings rather than a WordPress bug.

This tutorial shows how to increase the most common limits on an Ubuntu server running Apache:

- WordPress memory constants (`WP_MEMORY_LIMIT`, `WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT`)
- PHP `memory_limit`
- PHP `upload_max_filesize`
- PHP `post_max_size`

For background on how WordPress relates to these PHP directives, see the WordPress Developer Handbook page "PHP Optimization".

![SSH session on the server](images/01-ssh-session.png)

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu with SSH access (for example, a Hetzner Cloud server)
- A working WordPress installation
- Admin access to the server (root or a sudo-capable user)
- A text editor available on the server (`nano` or `vim`)

## Example terminology

This tutorial uses placeholders like:

- `YOUR_SERVER_IP`
- `YOUR_DOMAIN`
- `/var/www/html` (WordPress root)

Replace them with your own values.

## Step 1 - Connect via SSH and locate your WordPress root

SSH to the server:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

A common WordPress root on Apache installs is:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
ls -la
```

You should see `wp-config.php` and directories such as `wp-content/`, `wp-admin/`, and `wp-includes/`.

If you do not see `wp-config.php`, search for it:

```bash
sudo find /var/www -type f -name wp-config.php 2>/dev/null
```

Then `cd` into the directory that contains it.

![WordPress root directory](images/02-wp-root-listing.png)

## Step 2 - Back up configuration files

From the WordPress root directory, back up `wp-config.php`:

```bash
sudo cp -a wp-config.php wp-config.php.bak.$(date +%F)
```

Back up `.htaccess` if it exists:

```bash
test -f .htaccess && sudo cp -a .htaccess .htaccess.bak.$(date +%F)
```

## Step 3 - Increase WordPress memory limits in wp-config.php

WordPress has its own memory configuration constants that you can set in `wp-config.php`. The WordPress Developer Handbook documents these constants and explains how they interact with PHP's `memory_limit`.

Edit `wp-config.php`:

```bash
sudo nano wp-config.php
# or: sudo vim wp-config.php
```

Add the following lines above the line that says "That's all, stop editing":

```php
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
define('WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT', '512M');
```

Save and exit.

Notes:

- `WP_MEMORY_LIMIT` applies to frontend rendering.
- `WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT` applies to admin and logged-in contexts, and is commonly relevant for media operations.
- WordPress cannot exceed the PHP memory limit if PHP is capped lower than these values.

## Step 4 - Check how PHP is connected to Apache

Whether you can set PHP directives in `.htaccess` depends on how PHP runs behind Apache.

Run:

```bash
apache2ctl -M | grep -E 'php|proxy_fcgi|mpm'
```

Interpretation:

- If you see `php_module`, Apache is using mod_php and `.htaccess` directives like `php_value` typically work.
- If you see `proxy_fcgi_module`, the site is often using PHP-FPM, and `php_value` in `.htaccess` may cause a 500 error.

![Apache modules show PHP handler](images/04-apache-modules.png)

## Step 5 - Increase PHP limits (recommended approach for mod_php)

The WordPress Cloud App image from Hetzner installs Apache2 and WordPress along with PHP extensions. citeturn1view0

### Option A - Use .htaccess (recommended when apache2ctl shows php_module)

If Step 4 shows `php_module`, add PHP limits to the WordPress `.htaccess` file.

Edit `.htaccess` in the WordPress root:

```bash
sudo nano .htaccess
# or: sudo vim .htaccess
```

Add this block near the top (or near the existing WordPress section):

```apacheconf
# BEGIN WordPress PHP limits (mod_php)
php_value memory_limit 256M
php_value upload_max_filesize 64M
php_value post_max_size 64M
php_value max_execution_time 300
php_value max_input_time 300
# END WordPress PHP limits (mod_php)
```

The WordPress Developer Handbook notes that upload sizes are controlled by PHP `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`, and that `post_max_size` must be greater than or equal to `upload_max_filesize`. citeturn1view1

![Add PHP limits to .htaccess](images/05-htaccess-php-limits.png)

### Option B - If .htaccess is not supported (PHP-FPM), use .user.ini

If adding `php_value` triggers a 500 error, you are likely not running mod_php. In that case, use `.user.ini` instead.

Create or edit `.user.ini` in your WordPress root:

```bash
sudo nano .user.ini
```

Add:

```ini
memory_limit=256M
upload_max_filesize=64M
post_max_size=64M
max_execution_time=300
max_input_time=300
```

Save and exit.

## Step 6 - Restart services and verify the new limits

Restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

If you are using PHP-FPM, restart it too (replace `VERSION`):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart phpVERSION-fpm
```

Examples:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```

### Verify in WordPress Site Health

1. In WordPress admin, go to **Tools** -> **Site Health**
2. Open the **Info** tab
3. Check values such as memory limits and maximum upload size

![Site Health shows updated limits](images/06-site-health-limits.png)

### Verify with phpinfo (temporary)

Create a temporary file:

```bash
echo "<?php phpinfo();" | sudo tee /var/www/html/phpinfo.php >/dev/null
```

Open `http://YOUR_DOMAIN/phpinfo.php` and verify:

- `memory_limit`
- `upload_max_filesize`
- `post_max_size`

Then remove the file immediately:

```bash
sudo rm -f /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

![phpinfo shows updated PHP limits](images/07-phpinfo-limits.png)

## Step 7 - Troubleshooting and rollback

### 500 Internal Server Error after editing .htaccess

Likely causes:

- The server uses PHP-FPM (FastCGI), so `php_value` directives are not allowed in `.htaccess`.
- A directive was mistyped.
- `.htaccess` overrides are disabled.

Fix:

1. Restore your `.htaccess` backup (if you made one in Step 2):

   ```bash
   sudo cp -a .htaccess.bak.$(date +%F) .htaccess
   ```

   If you do not have a backup, remove only the block you added.

2. Restart Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

3. Use Step 5 Option B (`.user.ini`) or set the values in `php.ini` / PHP-FPM pool configuration.

### Upload size does not increase

Double-check these points:

- `post_max_size` is greater than or equal to `upload_max_filesize`. citeturn1view1
- A reverse proxy, WAF, or CDN is not enforcing its own request size limits.
- WordPress is not constrained by an application-level restriction in a plugin.

## Conclusion

You have now:

- Increased WordPress memory limits via `wp-config.php`
- Increased PHP memory and upload limits using the approach that matches your PHP runtime
- Verified the result and captured rollback steps
