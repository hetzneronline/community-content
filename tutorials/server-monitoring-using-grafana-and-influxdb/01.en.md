## Introduction

Grafana is Monitoring Software for Data visualization. You can display every data, on several Graphs or Gauges. We will use Telegraf for storing the Data into InfluxDB, which will be displayed on a Grafana Dashboard.

![header-image](images/header-image.png)

**Prerequisites**

For this tutorial you need a machine/server you want to monitor eg a Cloud-Server or a Dedicated-Root Server with Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04 OS. We assume you to be root user on this tutorial.

## Step 1 - Setup DNS Entry

We now set up a DNS record. In the end, a web server will run with Grafana. For an SSL certificate, this is necessary.

If you use the Hetzner DNS console, you can edit the following entry as you wish and insert it accordingly via the "manual Zonefile editing". Otherwise it would be necessary to create a DNS entry with your respective provider. We will proceed here with `grafana.yourdomain.com`.

Grafana address:

`grafana IN A <yourServerIPv4>`

`grafana IN AAAA <yourServerIPv6>`

Influx address:

`influx IN A <yourServerIPv4>`

`influx IN AAAA <yourServerIPv6>`

## Step 2 - Install InfluxDB

First we need to add the InfluxDB repositories to our OS:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | apt-key add -
$ source /etc/lsb-release
$ echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list
```

After that, we need to update and install the package:

```bash
$ apt-get update && apt-get install influxdb -y
```

Now we need to start and start our service and check if its running without problems:

Starting:

```bash
$ systemctl start influxdb
```

Checking:

```bash
$ systemctl status influxdb
```

The Output should look similar to this:

```
● influxdb.service - InfluxDB is an open-source, distributed, time series database
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/influxdb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2021-05-09 21:25:00 CEST; 2s ago
       Docs: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/
   Main PID: 6038 (influxd)
      Tasks: 8 (limit: 2286)
     Memory: 8.7M
     CGroup: /system.slice/influxdb.service
             └─6038 /usr/bin/influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf
```

We have now correctly Installed Influx. Your service should now already available on the default Port 8086

In order to start InfluxDB on restart, we need to run the following command:

```bash
$ systemctl enable influxdb
```

Now that we have installed influxdb correctly we will go to to the `influxdb cli` and create a admin- and telegrafuser for authentication. (Please use a secure password for authentication)

```
influx
```

```
> CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'password' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE USER telegraf WITH PASSWORD 'password' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> show users
```

The output should look like this:

```
user     admin
----     -----
admin    true
telegraf true
```

Leave the influx-cli with the command `exit`.

Now that we have created our Users, we can configure InfluxDB for basic auth.

Edit the file `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` with a text editor of your choice.

As a beginner you can use `nano` -> for example: `nano /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`

Uncomment the necessary lines to get an output like this:

```
[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
  enabled = true
  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  bind-address = ":8086"
  # Determines whether user authentication is enabled over HTTP/HTTPS.
  auth-enabled = true
```

To refresh our changes to the config, we need to restart InfluxDB

```bash
$ systemctl restart influxdb
```

## Step 3 - Install Telegraf

Telegraf will pass the necessary information, of the system to monitor, to InfluxDB.

Add the corresponding repositories for Telegraf.

(We already added these repositories beforehand, if you install Telegraf on additional machines, you would need to add them here.)

```bash
$ wget -qO- https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | apt-key add -
$ source /etc/lsb-release
$ echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list
```

Update your machine and install Telegraf

```bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install apt-transport-https -y && apt-get install telegraf -y
```

Now we do not start the software immediately, but we edit the `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`

```
## HTTP Basic Auth
  username = "telegraf"
  password = "password"
```

We need to add a configfile for the collection of some extra data:

```bash
touch /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/netquery.conf
```

Now that we have created the file edit it (`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/netquery.conf`).

Here you paste the following content

```
[[inputs.net]]
[[inputs.netstat]]
```

It’s possible to check your new configuration, isolated from the running Telegraf service:

```
telegraf --test --config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/netquery.conf
```

If the test runs well the output should look similar like this:

```

```

Restart telegraf and check its status:

```bash
$ systemctl restart telegraf
$ systemctl status telegraf
```

If everything runs without problems, also add it to the autostart:

```bash
$ systemctl enable telegraf
```

## Step 4 - Install Grafana

Finally, we can install Grafana for visualisation of the InfluxDB Tables and Values, which are created by Telegraf.

Therefore we install the neccesary software and add the grafana repository, after that we update and install Grafana.

```bash
$ apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
$ wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | apt-key add -
$ echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
$ apt-get update && apt-get install grafana -y
```

As we already did for InfluxDB and Telegraf we start the Software, check the Status and if everything runs well, we add it to the autostart:

```bash
$ systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start grafana-server
$ systemctl status grafana-server
```

If everything runs well, we also add it to the autostart:

```bash
$ systemctl enable grafana-server
```

## Step 5 - Install Nginx

If you would only use it on your local machine, you would not need to secure your connection, if you dont expose it to the internet. However, we also need an SSL Certificate for Grafana, so we need one anyway.

Therefore we need to get a SSL Certificate. On this tutorial we will use a nginx webserver in order to redirect the traffic and get a Certificate for `grafana.<example.com>` and `influx.<example.com>` via the Hetzner DNS API. In some parts we refer to the [Lets-Encrypt Tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/letsencrypt-dns).

```bash
$ apt-get -y install certbot nginx python3-certbot-nginx curl jq
$ touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy
```

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy` and paste the following edited config:

```
server {
  listen <yourServerIPv4>:443 ssl;
  server_name influx.yourdomain.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/influx.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/influx.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8086;
  }

}

server {
  listen <yourServerIPv4>:443 ssl;
  server_name grafana.yourdomain.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/influx.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/influx.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  }

}

server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
    server_name influx.yourdomain.com grafana.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;

}
```

Finally we need to create a simlink to activate the nginx configuration file.

```bash
$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/proxy
```

After editing we need to download some scripts in order to use the Hetzner-DNS API.

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dschoeffm/hetzner-dns-certbot/master/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh > /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dschoeffm/hetzner-dns-certbot/master/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh > /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh 
```

Now have to acquire a Hetzner-DNS API-Token. You can create yours here: [Hetzner DNS Console](https://dns.hetzner.com/settings/api-token)

We assume your token is called `keUgVnF7YwygZEpJ4q6P7REFDYH38lhW`.  Save your Token to file with the following command:

```bash
$ echo keUgVnF7YwygZEpJ4q6P7REFDYH38lhW > /etc/hetzner-dns-token
```

Now we create our Lets-Encrypt Certificate via DNS-Challenge with the help of Certbot.

```bash
$ certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --manual-auth-hook /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-auth.sh --manual-cleanup-hook /usr/local/bin/certbot-hetzner-cleanup.sh -d influx.yourdomain.com -d grafana.yourdomain.com
```

After that restart nginx

```bash
$ systemctl restart nginx.service
```

In order to automatically renew your Certificate you would need to create the following Cronjob.

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

On the end of the file you paste the following and save the file.

```
43 6 * * * certbot renew --post-hook "systemctl reload nginx"
```

With this crontab, certbot will run everyday on 6:43am. In order to renew your Lets-Encrypt Certificate. The Certificate will only renewed if its due to renewal. This is the case after 30 days left.

## Step 6 - Add a Datasource and a Dashboard

Go to `https://grafana.<example.com>` and login with the default credentials `User: admin` `password: admin`

After that go to "Datasources"

![add-datasource](images/add-datasource.png)

With "Add data source" you can add your local InfluxDB Database

Configure it as follows:

![add-datasource-details](images/add-datasource-details.png)

Now that we have a working datasource for Grafana, we can start importing a Dashboard for your Server.

![import-dashboard](images/import-dashboard.png)

There are a plenty of already availabile dashboards for Telegraf and InfluxDB.
As a example, we will work with a dashboard I created for this tutorial: [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14419](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14419)

![import-dashboard-further](images/import-dashboard-further.png)

Rename it to your needs and import it accordingly.

![import-dashboard-detailed](images/import-dashboard-detailed.png)

Save the dashboard by clicking the "save" icon in the upper right corner.

![save-dashboard.png](images/save-dashboard.png)

## Step 7 - Monitor other Servers (optional)

Now, in order to monitor your other Servers, you would only need to install telegraf on the corresponding machine and edit the `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`.

Here we repleace the `http://127.0.0.1:8086` with `https://influx.yourdomain.com:8086`.

```
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  ## The full HTTP or UDP URL for your InfluxDB instance.
  ##
  ## Multiple URLs can be specified for a single cluster, only ONE of the
  ## urls will be written to each interval.
  # urls = ["unix:///var/run/influxdb.sock"]
  # urls = ["udp://127.0.0.1:8089"]
   urls = ["https://influx.yourdomain.com"]
```

We also need to add the credentials for the telegraf user, again:

```
## HTTP Basic Auth
  username = "telegraf"
  password = "password"
```

After reloading Telegraf you can now choose another Host on your Dashboard.

## Conclusion

You are now able to use Grafana. For example you can now create additional dashboards and users. Grafana also offers an alerting function in case of e.g. unavailability of a specific target value.
