## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through automatically shutting down your Hetzner VPS once its monthly bandwidth crosses a specified limit (e.g., 19 TB). This is useful to avoid overage charges and maintain control over your server usage.

By following this guide, you’ll install a Python-based monitoring script, configure your Hetzner Cloud API, and set up a cron job that runs every 30 minutes to check and shut down your VPS when needed.

**Prerequisites**

* [Hetzner Cloud API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token)
* [SSH access to your VPS](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/add-ssh-key-to-your-hetzner-cloud)
* Basic knowledge of cron jobs and Python. (Don't worry, it's easy! I'll walk you through it.)

## Step 1 - Get Your Hetzner API Key and Server ID

1. Go to the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/).
2. Create an [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) from the project settings.
3. Your `HETZNER_SERVER_ID` is the last part of the URL when you visit your server:
```
https://console.hetzner.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/servers/<SERVER_ID>/overview
```
Save both values securely, you will need them in the script.


## Step 2 - Install the script on the VPS

1. SSH into your Hetzner VPS:

```bash
ssh root@<your_host>
```

2. Create a `bandwidth_monitor.py` file in your machine with the following content. Replace the `<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>` and `<YOUR_HETZNER_SERVER_ID_HERE>` with the values you saved in step 1:

```python
import os
import urllib.request
import urllib.error
import json
import sys
from datetime import datetime

API_TOKEN = "<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>"
SERVER_ID = "<YOUR_HETZNER_SERVER_ID_HERE>"

print(f"[{datetime.now()}] Script ran")
if not API_TOKEN or not SERVER_ID:
    print("Error: HETZNER_API_TOKEN and HETZNER_SERVER_ID must be set.")
    sys.exit(1)

TB = 1024**4
GB = 1024**3
SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 19 * TB


url = f"https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers/{SERVER_ID}"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}

try:
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=headers)
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
        data = json.loads(response.read().decode('utf-8'))
except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"HTTP Error fetching server data: {e.code} {e.reason}")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching server data: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)

server = data.get("server", {})
status = server.get("status", "unknown")
outgoing_traffic = server.get("outgoing_traffic") or 0

print(f"Current outgoing traffic: {outgoing_traffic / GB:.2f} GB")

if status == "running":
    if outgoing_traffic >= SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES:
        print("19 TB limit reached. Sending shutdown request...")
        try:
            shutdown_req = urllib.request.Request(f"{url}/actions/shutdown", method='POST', headers=headers)
            with urllib.request.urlopen(shutdown_req) as response:
                print("Shutdown request sent successfully.")
        except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
            print(f"HTTP Error during shutdown: {e.code} {e.reason}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during shutdown: {e}")
    else:
        print("Server running, but under 19 TB. No action taken.")
else:
    print(f"Server is not running (status: {status})")
```

## Step 3 - Set up a cron job to run the script every 30 minutes

Use the `crontab -e` command in the terminal to open the crontab editor and add the following line to run the script every 30 minutes:

```
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/hetzner-bandwidth-script && /usr/bin/python3 bandwidth_monitor.py >> cron.log 2>&1
```
The path to the script depends on where you saved it. Use `pwd` command to check the current directory. Always use the full path to the script. `cron.log` will log all output from the script. You can view the logs by running `cat cron.log` in the same directory.

## Step 4 - Adjust the Bandwidth Threshold (Optional)

In your Python script (`bandwidth_monitor.py`), the bandwidth threshold is set to `19 TB` by default. You can change this value if you want to trigger the shutdown at a different usage level.
```python
SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 19 * TB      # modify this value to your desired threshold
```

## Step 5 - Test the script

Run the script manually to test it:

```python
python3 bandwidth_monitor.py
```

You should see the output in the terminal. If the script detects that the bandwidth has crossed the threshold, it will send a shutdown request to the Hetzner API. Also, check your `cron.log` file to verify that the script ran successfully every 30 minutes.

## Conclusion

You've successfully automated your Hetzner VPS to shut down when the bandwidth threshold is reached. This setup helps prevent unexpected overcharges and allows for better resource management.
