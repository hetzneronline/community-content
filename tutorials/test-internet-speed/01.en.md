## Introduction

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to performing a speed test for your server. It explains the necessary steps to perform the test.

Tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** and **Debian 12**; can run on older versions, but not recommended.

## **Prerequisites:**
* A server with sudo privileges.
* The curl library should be installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

## **Installation Steps for the Speed Test:**
1. Add the Speedtest CLI repository by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/ookla/speedtest-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    ```

2. Install the Speedtest CLI with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install speedtest
    ```

## **Run the Speed Test:**
After installing, you can perform a speed test by running the following command:

```bash
sudo speedtest
```

## **Accept the License:**
During the first run, you may be prompted to accept the license. Type "yes" to proceed with the speed test.

This will initiate the speed test on your server, and accepting the license is necessary for the tool to function.
