## Introduction

The Hetzner script
[installimage](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage)
located on the [Hetzner Rescue
System](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/troubleshooting/hetzner-rescue-system)
provides an easy way to install various Linux distributions.

This tutorial shows how to use `installimage` to install an encrypted Debian 11
(Bullseye) operating system on a NVMe software RAID with LVM and add remote
unlocking via SSH (dropbear) in `initramfs` stored on a separate `/boot`
partition. The order of setup for the root partition is: `RAID ➔ LUKS ➔ LVM
➔ File System`. This tutorial was tested on an `AX41-NVMe` system with Debian
11.01 Bullseye.

**Prerequisites**

* Hetzner account
* Server with IPv4 address booted into the rescue system
* RSA or ECDSA/ED25519 SSH public key (can be created on the fly)
* No private networks attached on Hetzner Cloud

## Step 1 - Create or copy SSH public key

In order to remotely unlock the encrypted disk at least one SSH key is
required. This key will also be used to later login to the booted system. The
`dropbear` SSH daemon (version 2020.81-3) included in Debian 11.01 supports
Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) and elliptic curve keys. If you do not have such a
key, you need to generate one. This can be the case if a password is used to
access the rescue system. In case you already have such a key, continue with
step 2.

For example, to generate `ed25519` (a non `National Institute of Standards and
Technology` (NIST) elliptic-curve) SSH key run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Copy the public key to the rescue system and add it to existing keys.

```bash
cat id_ed25519.pub|ssh root@<your-host> -T 'cat>>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

## Step 2 - Create or copy installimage configuration file

When `installimage` is called without any options, it will search for the file
`/autosetup`. If it does not find it, it starts in interactive mode and will
open an editor after a distribution image has been selected. On exiting the
editor, the installation will proceed and the corresponding configuration is
saved as `/installimage.conf` on the file system of the installed system. In
this tutorial we will use such a configuration to install directly via the
`/autosetup` file.

Create the file `/autosetup` with the following content or copy it to the
server running the rescue system.

Note: Replace `<secret>` with a secure password and adjust drive names and
partitioning as needed. Usually Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) via `cryptsetup`
is configured for a maximum password length of 512 characters (the maximum
length was not verified for this tutorial).
When installing in UEFI mode, you need to additionally add `PART /boot/efi  esp  256M`.

```conf
CRYPTPASSWORD <secret>

SWRAID 1
SWRAIDLEVEL 1
DRIVE1 /dev/nvme0n1
DRIVE2 /dev/nvme1n1

PART  /boot  ext4    1G
PART  lvm    vg0    all crypt

LV  vg0  swap  swap  swap 32G
LV  vg0  root  /     xfs  all

BOOTLOADER grub

HOSTNAME <host.example.com>

IMAGE /root/images/Debian-1107-bullseye-amd64-base.tar.gz

SSHKEYS_URL /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This example configures 32G of swap and uses the `xfs` file system.
Other values or file systems, like `ext4` are possible.

## Step 3 - Create or copy post-install script

In order to remotely unlock the encrypted partition, we need to install and add
the `dropbear` SSH server to the `initramfs` which is stored on the unencrypted
`/boot` partition. This will also trigger the inclusion of `dhclient` to
configure networking, but without any extras. To enable support for Hetzner
Cloud, we need to add a hook which includes support for RFC3442 routes.

In order to run these additional steps we need a post-install script for
`installimage`.

Create a file `/tmp/post-install.sh` on the rescue system with the following
content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

add_rfc3442_hook() {
  cat << EOF > /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
#!/bin/sh

PREREQ=""

prereqs()
{
        echo "\$PREREQ"
}

case \$1 in
prereqs)
        prereqs
        exit 0
        ;;
esac

if [ ! -x /sbin/dhclient ]; then
        exit 0
fi

. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions
. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions

mkdir -p \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
cp -a /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/rfc3442-classless-routes \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
EOF

  chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
}

# Install hook
add_rfc3442_hook

# Copy SSH keys for dropbear
mkdir -p /etc/dropbear-initramfs
cp -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys

# Update system
apt-get update >/dev/null
apt-get -y install cryptsetup-initramfs dropbear-initramfs
```

Important note: make the post-install script executable:

```bash
chmod +x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

## Step 4 - Start installation

Before starting the installation, check again the content of the following
files:

* `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` - our public SSH key(s) (RSA or ECDSA/ed25519)
* `/autosetup` - `installimage` configuration
* `/tmp/post-install.sh` - is executable and contains the post-install script

Now we are ready to start the installation with the following command:

```bash
installimage -x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

Wait until the installation completes and check the `debug.txt` for any errors.

## Step 5 - Boot installed system

After the installation has finished and any errors are resolved (see section
**debugging** below in case), we can run `reboot` to restart the server and
boot the newly installed init RAM disk. We can watch the boot process if we
have a KVM attached or via remote console on a cloud instance.

After some time the server should respond to ping. Now login via SSH into busy
box init RAM disk using SSH `dropbear` and run the command `cryptroot-unlock`
to unlock the encrypted partition(s) from the `busybox` command line.

```
ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@<your-host>

The authenticity of host '<your-host> (<your-host>)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:uY/i2eu8jee8RB9aWwapQquSO+G6E/VMorWQ1fA9clM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '<your-host>' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
To unlock root partition, and maybe others like swap, run `cryptroot-unlock`.


BusyBox v1.30.1 (Debian 1:1.30.1-6+b3) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

~ # cryptroot-unlock
Please unlock disk luks-53152dbf-856e-4e13-b09f-8d05f01a43bc:
cryptsetup: luks-53152dbf-856e-4e13-b09f-8d05f01a43bc set up successfully
~ # Connection to <your-host> closed by remote host.
Connection to <your-host> closed.
```

If the password is correct the boot from the init RAM disk will continue to the
new installed system. Before the new system is up and running, we will
automatically be disconnected from the temporary SSH session of the init RAM
disk.

After a few seconds we can login to our new system via SSH. Be aware that if we
use the same name to connect to the init RAM disk of` busybox` via SSH
(`dropbear`) and to the booted system, SSH will give warnings about a changed
host name. It is advised to use different name. Either by using IP and name or
by setting up two different DNS names for the same IP. Buy doing this we keep
the SSH function of warning if the booted server host (Debian 11) finger print
changes.

## Step 6 - Verification (Optional)

The correct installation can be verified by `lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT` 
either from the rescue system or from the booted
system. The hierarchy of `NVMe ➔ MD (RAID) ➔ LUKS ➔ VLM ➔ XFS` is
clearly visible:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
NAME                                            FSTYPE          SIZE MOUNTPOINT

      └─vg0-root                                xfs               443.8G /

```

## Step 7 - Harden the system (Optional)

Writing the `cryptsetup` password inside the `/autosetup` file
is very convenient. A copy of this file is placed on the installed
root file system as `/installimage.conf`. And in `/installimage.debug`
we can find a line like `Sent install.conf to statsserver: HTTP/2 201`.

It is possible to update the `crypsetup` password with a different one manually
after the initial setup via `/autosetup`. The update procedure do __not__
require to store the password in a text file.

First test which slot the `crypsetup` password is stored. Usually it is slot 0.
This can be done with `cryptsetup --verbose open --test-passphrase <DEVICE>`.

```bash
cryptsetup --verbose open --test-passphrase /dev/md1
Enter passphrase for /dev/md1: <secret>
Key slot 0 unlocked.
Command successful.
```

Usually this should give the same result, but will display other
slots in the case more than one slot is used:

```bash
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/md1|grep luks2
  0: luks2
```

To change the `crypsetup` password, set the password for slot 0 with:

```bash
cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/md1 -S 0
Enter LUKS passphrase to be changed:
Enter new LUKS passphrase:
```

## Step 8 - Debugging (Optional)

The `installimage` is not idempotent in regard to software RAID. The devices
`/dev/md0` and `/dev/md1` are existent and if we would run the `installimage`
twice to reinstall the machine we will get errors like `Device /dev/md/1 is in
use`. In this case remove and stop the software RAID before running
`installimage` again.

```bash
mdadm --remove /dev/md0
mdadm --remove /dev/md1
mdadm --stop /dev/md0
mdadm --stop /dev/md1
```

## Conclusion

After configuration and executing `installimage`, booting into the
`initramfs`, entering the `cryptsetup` password, the installed system is
booted with a two tier process and can be used.

While the boot or reboot of the system needs one additional step (the manual
SSH session to the `busybox` init RAM disk) it adds a layer of security towards
the storage subsystem. However an unattended reboot is not possible with this
`dropbear` setup.
