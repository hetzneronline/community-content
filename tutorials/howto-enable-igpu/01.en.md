# Introduction

This article explains how to activate the integrated iGPU on Intel processors, using a Linux OS.
An iGPU can be used to render videos using `FFMPEG`.

**Requirements**

+ A dedicated server with an Intel CPU
+ An installed Linux operating system

## Step 1 - Check CPU for compatibility

To check if the CPU in your dedicated server has an integrated graphics chip, you can look up the datasheet of the CPU.

Intel provides a website for this purpose:
https://ark.intel.com/

On this page you can search for the CPU. If there is a tab called "Processor Graphics" in the datasheet, then that CPU has an integrated iGPU.

## Step 2 - Check if the iGPU is already activated

To check whether the iGPU is already active, the following command must be executed on the system:

```bash
ls -la /dev/dri
```
The following output confirms that the iGPU is disabled:

```bash
ls: cannot access '/dev/dri': No such file or directory
```

## Step 3 - Enable the iGPU

To enable the iGPU, the following steps must be performed.

Open the file `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hetzner.conf` in an editor.
In this file some entries must be commented out.

Here the entries `blacklist i915` and `blacklist i915_bdw` have to be commented out with a `#` at the beginning of the line.

The edited entries should look like this.

```bash
### i915 driver blacklisted due to various bugs
### especially in combination with nomodeset
#blacklist i915 
#blacklist i915_bdw
```

### Step 4 - Adjust the Grub settings

The Grub bootloader configuration needs to be adjusted as follows.

In the file `/etc/default/grub.d/hetzner.cfg` the entry ` GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset consoleblank=0"` must be changed.
From this entry, the word `nomodeset` must be removed.

(On Ubuntu 18.04, the file is located at `/etc/default/grub`)

Here is an example of how the above entry must be changed.

Before editing:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset consoleblank=0"
```

After editing:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="consoleblank=0"
```

Next, the grub configuration needs to be saved, which is done with this command:
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
After restarting the server, the iGPU should be active.

# Step 4 - Review the iGPU

The check can be performed with `ls -la /dev/dri`.

Now the output should look something like this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root       100 Mar  2 17:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root root      4400 Mar  2 17:57 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root        80 Mar  2 17:57 by-path
crw-rw----  1 root video 226,   0 Mar 16 19:55 card0
crw-rw----  1 root video 226, 128 Mar 16 19:55 renderD128
```

Alternatively `lspci` can be executed, which provides more detailed information.
```bash
sudo lspci -v -s $(lspci | grep VGA | cut -d" " -f 1)
```

If the output contains the entry `Kernel driver in use: i915` (penultimate line), then the iGPU is active.

## (Optional) Step 5 - Install Monitoring Tools

To monitor the usage of the iGPU you can use the `intel-gpu-tools`.

To install type: `sudo apt install intel-gpu-tools`
To run it type: `sudo intel_gpu_top`

## Conclusion

This article has covered how to enable the integrated iGPU on Intel CPUs and to monitor the utilization.
