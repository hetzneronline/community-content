## Introduction

Before you start installing the WordPress CMS on the server, you must meet the following conditions:

**Prerequisites**

* Server with Operating System Linux CentOS 7 [Minimal Installation ISO](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso)
* LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), [if you don't have it installed, please follow this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-on-centos-7)
* Root access
* SSH Tools
  * [Putty For Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * OpenSSH in Linux/macOS (available by default)

In the previous [LAMP Stack tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-on-centos-7), we created the domains example.com and holu.example.com. In this tutorial, we will install WordPress on both the main domain and the sub-domain.

**Information from the LAMP Stack that will be used**

* Main Domain: example.com
* Sub Domain: holu.example.com
* MySQL root password: holuP455##

## Step 1 - Create a MySQL database with an user and password

### Step 1.1 - Login to MySQL (with root)

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### Step 1.2 - Create users (and passwords)

* For example.com:

```sql
CREATE USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15exmp#';
```

* For holu.example.com:

```sql
CREATE USER 'holu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15holu#';
```

Example output of the command:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15exmp#';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> CREATE USER 'holu'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#TH15holu#';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

### Step 1.3 - Create the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
CREATE DATABASE holudb;
```

Example output of the command:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE holudb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

### Step 1.4 - Give the user access rights

This command will give the user full access to the database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'example'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON holudb.* TO 'holu'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

To save all changes, run the following command:

```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Note:
In the example above, we gave both users full access to the database. I suggest giving full access if this is on the production server. If you want to provide other access, please check the list below:

* ALL PRIVILEGES: Account will get full access to a MySQL database or table. (Grant all privileges at specified access level except GRANT OPTION and PROXY.)
* GRANT OPTION: Enable privileges to be granted to or removed from other accounts. Levels: Global, database, table, routine, proxy.
* CREATE: Enable database and table creation. Levels: Global, database, table.
* DELETE: Enable use of DELETE. Level: Global, database, table.
* DROP: Enable databases, tables, and views to be dropped. Levels: Global, database, table.
* INSERT: Enable use of INSERT. Levels: Global, database, table, column.
* SELECT: Enable use of SELECT. Levels: Global, database, table, column.
* UPDATE: Enable use of UPDATE. Levels: Global, database, table, column.

If you want other access levels, please check the reference directly [from MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html#grant-privileges)

Example output of the command:

```sql
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'example'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON holudb.* TO 'holu'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

Then exit mysql with the command: `quit`

## Step 2 - Install and configure WordPress

### Step 2.1 - Download and extract WordPress

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xvf latest.tar.gz
cd wordpress
```

### Step 2.2 - Copy the WordPress files to the public_html and grant Apache access

* For example.com:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
cp -r * /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
find /var/www/html/example.com/public_html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /var/www/html/example.com/public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

* For holu.example.com:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
cp -r * /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html
find /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /var/www/html/holu.example.com/public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### Step 2.3 - Configure WordPress

Now access your website from the browser. If example.com and holu.example.com displays the standard wordpress page, this means the installation was successful.

![First Page Wordpress](images/01-first-page-wp.png)

Click `Let's go` to continue to the next page.

![Database Configuration](images/02-example-db-configure.png)

![Database Configuration Success](images/03-db-configure-success.png)

On this page you have to set the website details, username and password.

![Wordpress Site Configuration](images/04-wp-site-configure.png)

The following page will appear if everything was setup correctly:

![Wordpress Site Configuration Success](images/05-wp-site-configure-success.png)

You will now be redirected to the login page. There you can enter the data according to your configuration on the previous page.

![Wordpress Login Pages](images/06-wp-login-pages.png)

Repeat step 2.3 for the website holu.example.com and any other websites you want to add.

## Fixes for potential Errors (Optional)

### Database Error

If you get an error as below:

![Wordpress Login Pages](images/07-db-error.png)

If you use the same MySQL version as in the [LAMP STACK tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lamp-on-centos-7), follow the steps below to fix it.

Edit your MySQL configuration:

```bash
nano /etc/my.cnf
```

Add this line, under `[mysqld]`:

```bash
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin = mysql_native_password
```

Restart the MySQL service:

```bash
systemctl restart mysqld
```

Login to MySQL and force MySQL to use native password for your user:

```sql
mysql -u root -p
ALTER USER 'example'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '#TH15exmp#';
```

Now it should be fixed, repeat the database configuration in your WordPress setup.

### Cannot write wp-config.php Error

![Cannot Write WP Config](images/08-wp-cannot-write.png)

This will be a serious problem because wordpress can't write any file to the server. To fix it, check the apache users access to your public_html directory:

```bash
ls -lha /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
```

Example output of the command:

```bash
total 1.6M
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Mar 17 00:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Mar 14 08:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 385K Mar 20 10:51 error.log
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4.0K Mar 20 10:53 public_html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.2M Mar 20 11:14 requests.log
```

Run the following command to grant the apache user access:

```bash
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/example.com/public_html
```

Example output of the command:

```bash
total 1.6M
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4.0K Mar 17 00:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root   root   4.0K Mar 14 08:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   385K Mar 20 10:51 error.log
drwxr-xr-x 5 apache apache 4.0K Mar 20 10:53 public_html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   1.2M Mar 20 11:14 requests.log
```

All files in the public_html folder will be owned by the apache user. So WordPress can write and upload files.

## Conclusion

Your server is now ready for use with the WordPress CMS website. You can also add other websites using the same steps.
