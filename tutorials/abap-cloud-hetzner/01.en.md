# SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial on a Hetzner AX41-NVMe Server

The ABAP Cloud Developer Trial is the official way to run a complete ABAP system locally or in a cloud environment.  
This guide shows how to deploy the SAP Trial image on a **Hetzner AX41-NVMe server** running **Debian 12**.  

The AX41-NVMe is ideal due to its **powerful Ryzen CPU**, **32 GB RAM**, and **fast NVMe SSDs**, which meet the high demands of the ABAP trial environment.

---

## Requirements

To run the trial smoothly, you need:  

- **Server**: Hetzner AX41-NVMe or similar  
- **Memory**: minimum 32 GB RAM  
- **Storage**: at least 200 GB free (image >50 GB decompressed + database growth)  
- **Operating System**: Debian 12 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS also works)  
- **Docker**: latest version  
- **Docker Hub account**: required to pull the SAP image  

---

## Prepare the System

Update your Debian system and install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

Login to Docker Hub (mandatory, as the image is private):

```bash
docker login
```

---

## Download the SAP Image

Find the available tags on Docker Hub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial/tags)  

Example (2023 tag):  

```bash
docker pull sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023
```

## Start the Container

SAP requires the hostname `vhcala4hci`. Use the following command to start the container with all necessary ports exposed:

```bash
docker run --stop-timeout 3600 -i   --name a4h   -h vhcala4hci   -p 3200:3200   -p 3300:3300   -p 8443:8443   -p 30213:30213   -p 50000:50000   -p 50001:50001   sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023   -agree-to-sap-license   -skip-limits-check
```

### Ports Overview
- `3200`: SAP GUI  
- `3300`: RFC Instance  
- `8443`: Cloud Connector  
- `30213`: HANA MDC Database  
- `50000/50001`: AS ABAP HTTP/HTTPS  

---

## Access the System

### Web Access
- HTTP: `http://<server-ip>:50000`  
- HTTPS: `https://<server-ip>:50001`  
- Cloud Connector: `https://<server-ip>:8443` (User: `Administrator`, PW: `manage`)  

### SAP GUI
- Application Server: `<server-ip>` or `vhcala4hci`  
- System ID: `A4H`  
- Instance Number: `00`  
- Client: `001`  
- User: `DEVELOPER`  
- Password: version-dependent, e.g. `ABAPtr2023#00`  

---

## Manage the Container

### Stop the container (gracefully)
```bash
docker stop -t 7200 a4h
```

### Restart the container
```bash
docker start -ai a4h
```

---

## Notes & Best Practices

- The initial startup takes **10â€“20 minutes**. Wait until CPU and memory usage stabilize before logging in.  
- The hostname `vhcala4hci` must be resolvable. Add it to `/etc/hosts` if necessary.  
- SAP licenses expire after ~90 days. Renew them via transaction `SLICENSE` or by copying a license file into the container.  
- For production-like setups, use a static IP and secure access with a firewall.

## Conclusion

With a **Hetzner AX41-NVMe server**, the SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial can be run stably and efficiently.  
Thanks to sufficient RAM, fast NVMe storage, and Dockerâ€™s flexibility, you get a complete ABAP development environment for testing, training, or proof-of-concepts â€” without compromising performance or reliability.
