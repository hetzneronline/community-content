## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to run the official **SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial** on a **Hetzner AX41-NVMe** server with **Debian 12**.  
You will install Docker, pull the SAP image, and start the container with the required hostname and ports.  
Result: a working ABAP system reachable via **SAP GUI** and **web browser**.

**Prerequisites**

- Hetzner AX41‑NVMe (or similar)  
- Debian 12 (fresh install recommended)  
- **≥ 32 GB RAM** and **≥ 200 GB free disk**  
- Docker installed and running  
- Docker Hub account (required to pull the image)

## Step 1 - Update the server and install Docker

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

## Step 2 - Log in to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

> The image is not available to anonymous users.

## Step 3 - Pull the SAP image

Find tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial/tags

```bash
docker pull sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:<TAGNAME>
```

## Step 4 - Run the container

SAP expects the hostname `vhcala4hci`. Start the container and expose all relevant ports:

```bash
docker run --stop-timeout 3600 -i --name a4h -h vhcala4hci \
  -p 3200:3200 -p 3300:3300 -p 8443:8443 \
  -p 30213:30213 -p 50000:50000 -p 50001:50001 \
  sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:<TAGNAME> \
  -agree-to-sap-license -skip-limits-check
```

**Ports**

- 3200: SAP GUI (inst. 00)  
- 3300: RFC (inst. 00)  
- 8443: SAP Cloud Connector  
- 30213: SAP HANA MDC  
- 50000/50001: AS ABAP HTTP/HTTPS

## Step 5 - Access

**Web**  
- HTTP: `http://<server-ip>:50000`  
- HTTPS: `https://<server-ip>:50001`  
- Cloud Connector: `https://<server-ip>:8443` (user `Administrator`, password `manage`)

**SAP GUI**  
- Application Server: `<server-ip>` or `vhcala4hci`  
- SID: `A4H`, Instance: `00`, Client: `001`, User: `DEVELOPER`  
- Password: version-dependent, e.g. `ABAPtr2023#00`

## Step 6 - Stop and restart

Graceful stop (gives HANA time to persist):
```bash
docker stop -t 7200 a4h
```

Start again with logs attached:
```bash
docker start -ai a4h
```

## Conclusion

You now have a stable **SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial** on a Hetzner **AX41‑NVMe** running **Debian 12**.  
From here, you can explore ABAP development, connect tools, and test scenarios.
