## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to setup custom domain for S3-compatible object storage using reverse proxy.
The advantages of custom domain is to enable seamless integration with existing infrastructure or services under a unified domain.

A custom domain can be configured in various ways, such as using a CNAME record or a reverse proxy.
This tutorial focuses on configuring a custom domain using a reverse proxy.

**Prerequisites**

* A server (e.g. with [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/))
* A S3-compatible bucket (e.g. with [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com))
* A domain you want to use (e.g. `storage.example.com`).

## Step 1 - Create Object Storage Bucket

Create a S3-compatible bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Bucket](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/creating-a-bucket)".
Make sure it is set to public access permissions. No much benefit of using custom domain for private buckets.

Create S3 credentials to access your bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Generating S3 keys](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/generating-s3-keys)".

## Step 2 - Create Server

Create a new server.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server)").
To install Docker and Docker Compose, follow the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Step 3 - Deploy Caddy

SSH to your server `ssh root@<server-ip>`.

Create a directory for your Docker Compose files and folders for the persistent storage of the Caddy container:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/caddy/data
```

### Step 3.1 - Create docker deployment and configuration files

`vim /opt/caddy/compose.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    container_name: caddy
    image: caddy:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
       - ./data/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
       - ./data/certs:/certs
       - ./data/config:/config
       - ./data/data:/data
       - ./data/sites:/srv
```

`vim /opt/caddy/data/Caddyfile`

```text
storage.example.com {
    tls {
        issuer acme {
            dir https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        }
    }
}

storage.example.com:443 {
  reverse_proxy https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com {
    header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
    header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
  }
}
```

### Step 3.2 - Start Caddy

```bash
cd /opt/caddy

docker compose up -d
```

**Note:**

The request url would be `https://storage.example.com/bucket-name/object.txt`.
It is equivalent to `https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/bucket-name/object.txt`.

### Step 3.3 - Create kubernetes deployment and configuration files (Optional)

Assuming you already have configured kubernetes, gateway api.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: caddy-storage
  namespace: caddy
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    service: caddy-storage
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: caddy-storage
  namespace: caddy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  revisionHistoryLimit: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      service: caddy-storage
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: caddy-storage
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: "caddy:latest"
          name: caddy
          ports:
            - name: http
              protocol: TCP
              containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /etc/caddy
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: caddy-storage-config

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: caddy-storage-config
  namespace: caddy
data:
  Caddyfile: |
    storage.example.com:80 {
      reverse_proxy https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com {
        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
      }
    }

---

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: caddy-storage-route
  namespace: caddy
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: kubernetes-gateway
      namespace: istio-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "storage.example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: caddy-storage
          port: 80
          weight: 100
```
