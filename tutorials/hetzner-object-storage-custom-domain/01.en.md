## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to setup a custom domain for S3-compatible object storage using reverse proxy.
The advantages of a custom domain are to enable seamless integration with existing infrastructure or services under a unified domain.

There are different ways to configure a custom domain, such as using a CNAME record or a reverse proxy.
This tutorial focuses on configuring a custom domain using a reverse proxy.

> **Note:** When using a reverse proxy, outgoing traffic is billed twice — once from the object storage to the proxy and once from the proxy to the client. However, this only has an impact for high download volumes with dozens of TB per month.

**Prerequisites**

* A server (e.g. with [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/))
* An S3-compatible bucket (e.g. with [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/))
* A domain you want to use (e.g. `storage.example.com`).

## Step 1 - Create Object Storage Bucket

Create an S3-compatible bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Bucket](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/creating-a-bucket)".
Make sure it is set to public access permissions. Not much benefit to using a custom domain for private buckets.

Create S3 credentials to access your bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Generating S3 keys](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/generating-s3-keys)".

## Step 2 - Create Server

Create a new server.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server)".
To install Docker and Docker Compose, follow the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Step 3 - Deploy Caddy

SSH to your server `ssh root@<server-ip>`.

Create a directory for your Docker Compose files and folders for the persistent storage of the Caddy container:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/caddy/data
```

### Step 3.1 - Create Docker deployment and configuration files

* Add a Docker compose file
  
  ```bash
  sudo vim /opt/caddy/compose.yaml
  ```
  Add the following content:
  ```yaml
  services:
    caddy:
      container_name: caddy
      image: caddy:latest
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
        - 80:80
        - 443:443
      volumes:
         - ./data/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
         - ./data/certs:/certs
         - ./data/config:/config
         - ./data/data:/data
         - ./data/sites:/srv
  ```

<br>

* Add a Caddyfile

  ```bash
  sudo vim /opt/caddy/data/Caddyfile
  ```
  Add the following content:
  
  > Replace `storage.example.com` with your own domain.  
  > Replace `fsn1.your-objectstorage.com` with the endpoint of your object storage bucket. If the bucket name comes after the endpoint (e.g. `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>`) add your endpoint without the bucket name.
  
  ```text
  storage.example.com {
  
      tls {
          issuer acme {
              dir https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
          }
      }
  
      reverse_proxy https://<bucket_name>.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com {
      #reverse_proxy https://s3-endpoint.example.org {
        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
      }
  }
  ```

### Step 3.2 - Start Caddy

```bash
cd /opt/caddy
docker compose up -d
docker ps
```

After the Docker container started, you can access your files via `storage.example.com`.

If your bucket name comes after the endpoint, note:

The request URL would be `https://storage.example.com/<bucket_name>/object.txt`.  
It is equivalent to `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>/object.txt`.

### Step 3.3 - Create Kubernetes deployment and configuration files (Optional)

Assuming you already have configured Kubernetes, [gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api).

> Replace `storage.example.com` with your own domain.  
> Replace `fsn1.your-objectstorage.com` with the endpoint of your object storage bucket. If the bucket name comes after the endpoint (e.g. `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>`) add your endpoint without the bucket name.

          volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /etc/caddy
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: caddy-storage-config

        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
      }
    }

## Conclusion

You should now be able to access the contents of your S3-compatible object storage via a custom domain.
