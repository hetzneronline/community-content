## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to setup a custom domain for S3-compatible object storage using reverse proxy.
The advantages of a custom domain are to enable seamless integration with existing infrastructure or services under a unified domain.

There are different ways to configure a custom domain, such as using a CNAME record or a reverse proxy.
This tutorial focuses on configuring a custom domain using a reverse proxy.

**Prerequisites**

* A server (e.g. with [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/))
* An S3-compatible bucket (e.g. with [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/))
* A domain you want to use (e.g. `storage.example.com`).

## Step 1 - Create Object Storage Bucket

Create an S3-compatible bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Bucket](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/creating-a-bucket)".
Make sure it is set to public access permissions. Not much benefit to using a custom domain for private buckets.

Create S3 credentials to access your bucket.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Generating S3 keys](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/getting-started/generating-s3-keys)".

## Step 2 - Create Server

Create a new server.
With Hetzner, see the getting started "[Creating a Server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server)".
To install Docker and Docker Compose, follow the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Step 3 - Deploy Caddy

SSH to your server `ssh root@<server-ip>`.

Create a directory for your Docker Compose files and folders for the persistent storage of the Caddy container:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/caddy/data
```

### Step 3.1 - Create Docker deployment and configuration files

* Add a Docker compose file
  
  ```bash
  sudo vim /opt/caddy/compose.yaml
  ```
  Add the following content:
  ```yaml
  services:
    caddy:
      container_name: caddy
      image: caddy:latest
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
        - 80:80
        - 443:443
      volumes:
         - ./data/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
         - ./data/certs:/certs
         - ./data/config:/config
         - ./data/data:/data
         - ./data/sites:/srv
  ```

<br>

* Add a Caddyfile

  ```bash
  sudo vim /opt/caddy/data/Caddyfile
  ```
  Add the following content:
  
  > Replace `storage.example.com` with your own domain.  
  > Replace `fsn1.your-objectstorage.com` with the endpoint of your object storage bucket. If the bucket name comes after the endpoint (e.g. `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>`) add your endpoint without the bucket name.
  
  ```text
  storage.example.com {
  
      tls {
          issuer acme {
              dir https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
          }
      }
  
      reverse_proxy https://<bucket_name>.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com {
      #reverse_proxy https://s3-endpoint.example.org {
        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
      }
  }
  ```

### Step 3.2 - Start Caddy

```bash
cd /opt/caddy
docker compose up -d
docker ps
```

After the Docker container started, you can access your files via `storage.example.com`.

If your bucket name comes after the endpoint, note:

The request URL would be `https://storage.example.com/<bucket_name>/object.txt`.  
It is equivalent to `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>/object.txt`.

### Step 3.3 - Create Kubernetes deployment and configuration files (Optional)

Assuming you already have configured Kubernetes, [gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api).

> Replace `storage.example.com` with your own domain.  
> Replace `fsn1.your-objectstorage.com` with the endpoint of your object storage bucket. If the bucket name comes after the endpoint (e.g. `https://s3-endpoint.example.org/<bucket_name>`) add your endpoint without the bucket name.

              containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /etc/caddy
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: caddy-storage-config

      reverse_proxy https://<bucket_name>.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com {
      #reverse_proxy https://s3-endpoint.example.org {
        header_up Host {http.reverse_proxy.upstream.hostport}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
      }
    }

            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:

          port: 80
          weight: 100
```

## Conclusion

You should now be able to access the contents of your S3-compatible object storage via a custom domain.
