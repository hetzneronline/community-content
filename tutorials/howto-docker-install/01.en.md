## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Docker CE (Community Edition), how to create your first container and how to uninstall Docker.

> When you create a new Hetzner Cloud Server, you can select the [Hetzner Cloud App Docker](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/apps/list/docker-ce) and `docker-ce` will automatically be preinstalled on the server.

__Containers__

With containers it is possible to run software in an isolated environment on the system. This means that in a container you could run a different version of some software that you also have on your host, for example. Because of this isolation, you can create an entire environment that includes certain software and all its dependencies and use Docker images to share this container with other Docker users without having to worry about their operating systems or software that they already have installed on their host. In Linux, this isolated environment can be achieved with cgroups and namespaces. Cgroups control which resources a process can use (e.g. CPU). Namespaces control what a process can see.

Cgroups and namespaces are already on the system even before users create their first container. Each namespace type contains information about a specific property (mount points, process ID, ...). Every running process is allocated one namespace of each type. If two namespaces of the same type are available, the user can choose which namespace to use for a certain process. This option is basically what Docker is based on. For each running Docker container, new namespaces with their own rules and configurations are created to define individual mount points and network settings, for example.

Important namespaces and their use explained:

- `PID` - __process ID namespace__
  
  Every running process is allocated an individual identification. Within each PID namespace, the identification numbers go from __1__ upwards. Also, only the processes that have been started within a certain PID namespace are visible to this very namespace. Creating a new PID namespace is an own process that needs to be started in an existing PID namespace. Because of this, new PID namespaces automatically become child namespaces of the PID namespace they were created in (parent namespace). Next to its own processes, a parent namespace can also see the processes that are running in its child namespaces.

  A PID namespace only exists as long as it has at least one running process. Once the final process within a PID namespace stops, the PID namespace is automatically deleted by the system.

- `UTS` - __UNIX timesharing-system namespace__
  
  This is used to determine the hostname which is given to a process. An own hostname can be helpful with log files, for example. Regarding Docker containers in specific, different hostnames can also be helpful to see where a command will be executed, as the command prompt also includes the hostname. If the host and the container shared the same hostname, it would not be clear if you're in a running session on the host or the container from just looking at the command prompt.

- `NET` - __network namespace__
  
  This is used to give one or more processes their own network interface. Each interface (or each NET namespace) has its own firewall rules and routing tables. Different NET namespaces that are running on the same host, are not automatically connected. To communicate from one NET namespace to another, the network settings have to be changed first.

- `MNT` - __mount namespace__

  This is used to give one or more processes their own file system and mount points.

![namespaces](images/docker-install.en.gif)

> Namespaces are allocated per process. For container 1 this means that processes `6`, `7` and `8` (process tree PID 1) are each allocated the namespaces UTS 2, PID 2, NET 2 and MNT 2.<br>
> You can use `ls -al /proc/self/ns` to get the namespaces of the current process. The IDs of the namespaces should be different for the host and for a Docker container.

## Step 1 - Installing Docker Engine

You can install Docker via a package. Compared to the source code, packages are already compiled, and they include scripts that are used to automatically install the software and its dependencies.

Often, a software package is provided directly by the software vendor. However, packages can be provided by more than just one vendor. This is also the case with Docker. A package to install Docker Engine is provided by Docker Inc. as well as Debian and Ubuntu. The packages can be downloaded from archives, also known as package repositories. The differences between those packages are explained in more detail [below](#differences-between-dockerio-and-docker-ce).

You can use the `apt` command to manage your packages. This command is used to access a repository via HTTP and to then download a package from there. Once the package is on the system, a GPG key is used to verify it. If it is verified that the package was not modified by a third party, the package is used to install the software. Such as most repositories, the Debian/Ubuntu repository can be accessed via HTTP. The Docker repository, on the other hand, can only be accessed via HTTPS. `apt` does not automatically support HTTPS. In order to use `apt` to access the Docker repository, you will first have to install an additional package.

This means:

- Package is downloaded from the repository (package archive) 
- Package is verified via a GPG key
- Docker is installed from the package

The following information is required to successfully perform these steps:

- URL of the repository
  - Docker [Debian / Ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux)
  - Debian [AMD/ARM](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/docker.io/), Ubuntu [AMD](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/d/docker.io) / [ARM](http://ports.ubuntu.com/pool/universe/d/docker.io/)
- GPG key of the repository
  - Docker [Debian](https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/) / [Ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/)
  - Debian, Ubuntu [AMD](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/project/) / [ARM](http://ports.ubuntu.com/project/)

The repository and the corresponding GPG key of __Debian/Ubuntu__ are automatically on the system.

The repository and the corresponding GPG key of __third parties__ such as Docker need to be added.

To install [Docker Engine](https://github.com/moby/moby) you can choose from `docker.io` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `docker-ce` (Docker).

Since the repository and the corresponding GPG key of Debian/Ubuntu are already on the system, the `docker.io` package can be installed right away. To install `docker-ce`, you will first have to add the missing information.

The following options are explained in more detail below:

- [Option 1 - Installing `docker.io`](#option-1---installing-dockerio) - For a quick start

  Steps:

  * Install Docker

- [Option 2 - Installing `docker-ce`](#option-2---installing-docker-ce)

  Steps:

  * Add Dockers official GPG key
  * Add the Docker repository  
  * Install HTTPS support for `apt`
  * Install Docker

The fact that the `docker.io` package can be installed immediately, makes it perfect for a quick start. However, if you do intend to continue to use Docker after this tutorial, it makes sense to understand the differences between those two packages. You can find a brief explanation below.

### Differences between `docker.io` and `docker-ce`

At a glance:

|              | docker-ce                                            | docker.io                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vendor**   | `Official` Docker Inc.                               | Debian / Ubuntu                                          |
| **Source**   | [Docker-Repository](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/README.md) | Debian/Ubuntu Repository              |
| **Stream**   | Upstream                                             | Downstream                                               |
| **Updates**  | Updates are directly available                       | Updates are a little bit behind                          |
| **Packages** | Third-party software is included in the `containerd.io` package | Third-party software is installed via separate packages  |

The table shows two main differences:

1. Vendor

   - `docker-ce` is the official software package provided by Docker Inc.. Docker Engine is directly installed from the [Source Repository](https://github.com/moby/moby).<br><br>Updates are directly available.

   - `docker.io` is the software package provided by Debian/Ubuntu. Docker Engine is not installed from the [source repository](https://github.com/moby/moby) (upstream) itself. Instead, the software package comes from its own Debian/Ubuntu package repository (downstream) which includes Docker Engine. Basically, the source code of Docker Engine was taken from the upstream and modified.<br><br>Updates of the source repository (upstream) are not directly availably in the package repository (downstream) of `docker.io`. This means it is likely going to take some time before the latest `docker-ce` version becomes available for `docker.io` too.
    
   You can use `apt-cache policy` (Ubuntu) or `apt list` (Debian) to see which versions are currently available:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   apt-cache policy docker.io
   apt-cache policy docker-ce
   ```

   > For Debian, please replace `apt-cache policy` with `apt list`. Please also note that the latest version of `docker-ce` is only shown if the docker repository has already been added, see [Option 2 - Installing `docker-ce`](#option-2---installing-docker-ce).

   You can use the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/) to compare the different Docker Engine versions of `docker.io` and `docker-ce`.

2. Packages

   Software such as Docker is very complex. Several different tasks need to be covered and completed. For some tasks, there are already suitable solutions that have been developed, tested, and optimized by third parties. Often, it makes sense to use this third-party software and to incorporate it in the own software rather than developing an own version. This is also the case with Docker.

   The approach to install third-party software differs between the `docker-ce` and `docker.io` packages.

   - `docker.io`<br>The package includes information about other packages that are required for the software to run without errors. These additional packages are called dependencies. In most cases, the dependencies are downloaded and installed automatically before the requested software is installed. New updates for the additional packages are directly available.

   - `docker-ce`<br>Third-party software is not installed directly. Instead, the software is included in the `containerd.io` package by Docker. New updates for any software that is part of the package is not directly available. Instead, the newest version only comes with the next update for the entire `containerd.io` package.

   Two examples for those different approaches are `containerd` and `runc`.

   With the Debian/Ubuntu package `docker.io`, you will also automatically install the `containerd` package and the `runc` package. New updates for `containerd` and `runc` are directly available, independent of Docker updates.<br>
   Since `containerd` and `runc` are separate packages, they are also available for all other packages on the server.

   With the Docker Inc. package `docker-ce`, you will not install a `containerd` package or a `runc` package. Instead, you will install Dockers other package `containerd.io`. `containerd` and `runc` are part of the `containerd.io` package. New updates for `containerd` and `runc` are not immediately available. Instead, the newest version only comes with the next update for the `containerd.io` package.<br>
   `containerd` and `runc` are only available for Docker (`docker-ce`). Other software on the same system with the same dependencies have to install `containerd` or `runc` separately. Therefore, you can end up installing `containerd` or `runc` more than just once. This could be a good approach if several packages depend on different versions of `containerd` or `runc`, for example.

   At a glance:

   | Executable commands                    | docker.io            | docker-ce               |
   | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
   | runc                                   | `runc` package       | `containerd.io` package |
   | containerd                             | `containerd` package | `containerd.io` package |
   | dockerd, docker-init, <br>docker-proxy | `docker.io` package  | `docker-ce` package     |
   | docker                                 | `docker.io` package  | `docker-ce-cli` package |

   The table above shows that `docker.io` uses a separate package for each software that comes from a different vendor. In Debian/Ubuntu, both Docker packages are installed as one.

   `docker-ce` also uses several packages. Here, one package is used for third-party software (`containerd.io`), one package for Docker itself (`docker-ce`) and another package for the Docker command line tool (`docker-ce-cli`). The `containerd.io` package includes software from two different vendors. If one of the vendors releases a new update, it will not be available until the entire `containerd.io` has its next update.

#### Option 1 - Installing `docker.io`

As mentioned before, a package's repository and the corresponding GPG key have to be on the system to install the package. The official repository of the operating system is automatically available. You can view it here:

  - Repository: `cat /etc/apt/sources.list`
  - GPG key: `ls /usr/share/keyrings`

Follow the following steps to install `docker.io`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

The `docker.io` package should now be installed. Next, you can go to [Step 2 - Adding the user to the docker group](#step-2---adding-the-user-to-the-docker-group).

#### Option 2 - Installing `docker-ce`

To install the package, you will need the [Docker repository](https://download.docker.com/linux/) from which it will be downloaded and the Docker GPG key ([Debian](https://download.docker.com/linux/debian) / [Ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu)).

Follow the following steps:

- Add Dockers official GPG key
  
  The `apt` command will first download the package from the repository. Then, the package will be verified via the GPG key. The GPG key consists of a private key and a public key. You will need the public key. You can use the `gpg` command to add the key. This command is part of the `gnupg` package.
  
  - If `gnupg` is not yet installed, install it now:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install gnupg
    ```

  - Add the GPG key on __Ubuntu__:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

  - Add the GPG key on __Debian__:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

  This command will download the GPG key from the docker repository at `https://download.docker.com` and then save the key locally in `/usr/share/keyrings` with the name `docker-archive-keyring.gpg`.

  Once the GPG key was downloaded, you can list it:

  ```bash
  ls -al /usr/share/keyrings
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 May 17 08:49 .
  drwxr-xr-x 99 root root 4096 May 17 08:37 ..
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root 2760 May 17 08:49 docker-archive-keyring.gpg
  ```

- Add the Docker repository

  To give APT access to the repository, you will have to add the repository link to the directory that APT uses to manage all available repositories:

  - `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`

  Add the repository:

  - Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

  - Debian:
    ```bash
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

  > Instead of the variables, you can also state the information itself: <br>
  > Enter `dpkg --print-architecture` or `lsb_release -cs` in your CLI and replace the entire variable in the command above with your output.

  The command creates a new file called `docker.list` in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`. The text in quotation marks is added as the first line in the new file. The variables `$(dpkg --print-architecture)` and `$(lsb_release -cs)` are automatically replaced with the actual information.
  
  You can use `cat` to open the new `docker.list` file:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
  ```

  Example output:

  ```
  deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy stable
  ```

  This means the following:

  ```
  <archive-type> [<architecture> <GPG-key>] <repository-URL> <version> <updates>
  ```

  - __Archive type:__ Specifies what can be downloaded from the repository (`deb`, `deb-src`). `deb-scr` would mean that you can download a tarball, for example. `deb` means that you can download `deb` packages (e.g. `docker-ce`).
  
  - __Architecture__: `amd64` or `armhf` would be some examples. If you enter `dpkg --print-architecture` in your CLI, you will be shown the architecture of your device.
  
  - __GPG key__: The path to your GPG key.
  
  - __Repository URL__: The URL that can be used to access the repository.
  
  - __Version__: The version of the operating system. Next to the release number, each version also has a codename (e.g. __Focal__ Fossa). This codename is given here. If you enter `lsb_release -cs` in your CLI, you will be shown the version of your operating system.
  
  - __Updates__: You could choose `stable` or `test`, for example. With `stable` you would get the latest releases for general availability. With `test` you would get versions that are ready for testing but not yet in general availability.

- Install HTTPS support for `apt`

  The `apt` command is used to download packages via `HTTP`. However, Docker packages are available via `HTTPS`.
  
  The `s` in `HTTPS` stands for _secure_ and indicates that the webpage has a TLS/SSL certificate. This certificate ensures that the entire traffic between the client that tries to access the webpage and the server that hosts the webpage is encrypted. TLS/SSL certificates are issued by certificate authorities (CA). Before the connection to a `HTTPS` webpage is established, the client refers to its certificate authority to verify the certificate. Often, the client is a browser. In this case, the client will be the CLI.

  These are the requirements for `apt` to communicate via HTTPS:

  - Support HTTPS (`apt-transport-https`)
  - Support HTTP/HTTPS traffic via CLI (`curl`)
  - Have a list of known certificate authorities (`ca-certificates`)

  > `apt` versions 1.5 and above do support HTTPS. For older versions, you will have to additionally install the above-mentioned packages.

  Install the packages mentioned above to enable `apt` to download a package from an HTTPS repository:

  ```
  sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
  ```

  > Since `curl` is also needed to download HTTP packages via the CLI, it is likely that it is already installed. In this case, the installation will automatically be skipped.  

- Install Docker

  The `apt` command is used to download a package via HTTP and to verify the package via a GPG key.

  With the previous steps you have:

  - Added Dockers official GPG key
  - Added the Docker repository (HTTPS-URL)
  - Added new packages so that `apt` also supports HTTPS

  Now, you can install the Docker package:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  ```

If you don't want to follow those steps again, you can also use the following options to install `docker-ce`:

- [Hetzner Cloud App Docker](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/apps/list/docker-ce)
- Docker Convenience Script [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script) / [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script)

## Step 2 - Adding the user to the docker group

Before you get started with Docker, you should add your user to the docker group. When you create or modify a docker container, you will need two things. You will need the docker command line `docker`, which is used by the user to execute commands, and the Docker daemon, which receives the commands and starts processes if necessary. `docker` and the Docker daemon do not communicate directly. Instead, the Docker daemon socket is used as a communication interface between them. This means, every `docker` command that is executed, first goes to the Docker daemon socket which then passes it on to the Docker daemon. You can use `ls -al /var/run/docker.sock` to show the permissions of the Docker daemon socket:

```
srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 May 17 11:29 /run/docker.sock
```

```
<permissions> <hard-link-count> <owner> <group> <bytes> <modification> <name>
```

The third field shows the owner, in this case __root__. The fourth field shows the group it belongs to, in this case __docker__. The first field shows their permissions.

The permissions of the Docker daemon socket show that the owner __root__ and the group __docker__ have read and write permissions (`rw-`) and that any other users do not have any permissions at all (`---`).

If you use a non-root user who is not added to the docker group, to execute a `docker` command without a `sudo`, you will likely be prompted an error like this:

```
ERROR: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

The docker group has read and write permission. This means, if your user is added to the docker group, this error will not be prompted. The docker group is automatically created at the Docker installation.

- Add your user to the docker group:

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker holu
  ```

  > Please replace `holu` with your own username. Also, remember to add the `-a` (append). This is required to prevent that your user gets removed from any other groups that are not mentioned after the `-G` option.

- Check whether your user has successfully been added to the docker group:

  ```bash
  groups holu
  ```

  > Please replace `holu` with your own username.

  Output:

  ```
  holu : holu docker
  ```

  > In case your group is not showing yet, you might have to end the connection and reconnect for it to update. Alternatively, you can also use this command to update it:

  > ```bash
  > su - holu
  > ```

As long as your user is in the docker group, you can use `docker` without `sudo` permissions.

If you do __not__ add your user to the docker group, remember to add a `sudo` in front of every `docker` command that is used in the next steps.

## Step 3 - Creating a test container

Now that your user is in the docker group, you can create your fist container without `sudo` permissions and test if the installation of Docker Engine was successful.

- Test docker

  First, make sure you can use the `docker` command.

  ```bash
  docker -v
  ```

  The output should show the Docker version that was installed. If this worked, you can now move on to create a container.

- Create a container

  Docker containers are created from docker images which determine the contents of the containers. You can use a Dockerfile to create your own image or you can import existing images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). To test if the installation of Docker Engine was successful, it will be enough to import an image from Docker Hub. In general, there are two main commands, `docker pull` and `docker run`.

  - `docker pull <image-name>` is used to import an image from Docker Hub. This command does not create a container.
  - `docker run <image-name>` is used to create a container from an image. The image specified in the command is first searched on the system. If this image does not exist, the search is then continued on Docker Hub. If this image does exist on Docker Hub, it is automatically imported. Then, this image is used to create a new container.
  
  You can use `docker pull` to import the image from Docker Hub, followed by `docker run` to create a new container from this image, or you can directly use `docker run` and execute both steps with one command:

  ```bash
  docker run hello-world
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
  latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

  ...

  Hello from Docker!
  This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

  ...
  ```

  The output shows that an image called `hello-world` was first searched on the system. When no image was found, the search was continued on Docker Hub. From there, the `hello-world` image was imported and then used to create the new container.

- List docker images and docker containers

  List the imported docker image:

  ```bash
  docker image ls
  ```

  List the new container:

  ```bash
  docker container ls -a
  ```

  > The `-a` indicates that all containers should be shown. This also includes containers that are stopped. The `hello-world` container does not have any running processes. Therefore, the container was automatically stopped as explained in the introduction.

## Step 4 - Uninstalling Docker Engine

- Uninstall `docker.io`
    
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove docker.io
  ```

- Uninstall `docker-ce`
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  ```

## Conclusion

In the previous steps you learned how to install the `docker-ce` or the `docker.io` package, how to add your user to the docker group and how to create your first container to see if the installation was successful. Next, you can check out the tutorial "[Creating a Docker image and container](/tutorials/howto-docker-container)", for example.
