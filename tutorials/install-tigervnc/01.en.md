## Introduction

[TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) is an open-source VNC (Virtual Network Computing) software, that allows users to use graphical applications on servers.

**Prerequisites**

* A server running Ubuntu 18.04 (tested)

## Step 1 - Installing packages

The easiest way of installing TigerVNC on a new system is by using the `apt` repository.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
# Install virtual window manager, terminal emulator, xfce and tigervnc
$ sudo apt install fvwm xterm xfce4 xfce4-goodies gnome-session tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-common
```

## Step 2 - Configure and start the VNC server

### Step 2.1 - Start and kill the VNC server

To start the server you can run the following command:

```bash
$ vncserver
```

On the first start you must enter a VNC password.

To kill VNC instances run the following commands:

```bash
# Kill all running VNC instances
$ vncserver -kill :*

# Kill only one instance by id
$ vncserver -kill :<id>
```

To list all running instances you can run the following command:

```bash
$ vncserver -list
```

### Step 2.2 - Configure the VNC server

You can create a configuration file at `~/.vnc/xstartup`.

```bash
# Create the startup file
$ touch ~/.vnc/xstartup

# Set the file permission
$ chmod 700 ~/.vnc/xstartup

# Edit the file
$ vi ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

An example configuration for xfce4:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
```

### Step 2.3 - Complete configuration

Finish the configuration by starting the server:

```bash
$ vncserver
```

## Step 3 - Connect to VNC

To connect from your local computer to the VNC server first open an SSH tunnel to the server:

```bash
$ ssh holu@10.0.0.1 -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -N
```

After this you can use a VNC client to connect to the server with the address `127.0.0.1`.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to access your server via VNC (for example by using the `vncviewer` client provided by TigerVNC).
