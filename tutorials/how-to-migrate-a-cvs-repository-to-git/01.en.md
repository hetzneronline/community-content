## Introduction

As a relative young web developer I have had to experience the fact that many software companies, which were founded 20, 30 or more years ago, are still using old version control systems like CVS.

There are 2 possible difficulties with this fact. The first issue is that maybe most of the developers in the team don't want to change the current version control system they are using just because they are exhausted of reinventing themselves after many cycles of software reinvention for the company. The second problem and according to me the most important one is that CVS has died leaving a number of security concerns like the insecure pserver protocol.

When the security that protects the business logic is affected, it is imperative to migrate to a much more secure tool. Nowadays the safest and most stable version control system is Git and no one will question it, so my goal in this tutorial is to show you how to migrate from CVS to Git.

### Why Git? a little comparison between Git and CVS

- CVS is not being actively developed since 12 years ago. The last update was published on May 8, 2008.
- [CVS supports only SSH and its own insecure pserver protocol with no user authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/cvs.html#why-migrate)
- All operations in Git are atomic, this means either they succeed as whole, or they fail without any changes. The operations in CVS are not atomic and the repository can be left in an inconsistent state.
- Git supports SSH, HTTP/HTTPS.

**Prerequisites**

- Root access to the CVS Server
- [GNU Make](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Make) installed.
- [Git](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) installed.
- A couple of waiting hours depending on how old the history of the CVS is.

## Step 1 - Clone and install the cvs2svn project

- Access as root on the host location where the cvs repo is located.
- Clone the [cvs2svn](https://github.com/mhagger/cvs2svn) project from the author's git repository and install it.
- This command will install the [cvs2svn](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~jacob/cvs2svn/cvs2svn.html) and the [cvs2git](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~jacob/cvs2svn/cvs2git.html) tools:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mhagger/cvs2svn.git
  cd cvs2svn && make install && cd ...
  ```

## Step 2 - Start the migration

Please note that the following steps have some limitations. One important limitation is the fact that the cvs2svn tool doesn't convert .cvsignore files into .gitignore ones. [For more limitations please click here](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~jacob/cvs2svn/cvs2git.html#docs) or read the documentation file located at `www/cvs2svn.html` on the project git repository.

- Make sure the default branch is called `main` branch. `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`
- Create a temp folder on the same folder where the cvs folder is located. `mkdir temp`
- Execute the migration command for creating the dump files. This could take a couple of hours and maybe days depending on the size and the commit history of the cvs repository. **Don't forget to change the cvs_path_name module_name**

  ```bash
    cvs2git \
    --blobfile=temp/git-blob.dat \
    --dumpfile=temp/git-dump.dat \
    --keep-cvsignore \
    --retain-conflicting-attic-files \
    --encoding=ascii \
    --encoding=utf8 \
    --encoding=utf16 \
    --fallback-encoding=utf8 \
    ./cvs_path_name/module_name
  ```

## Step 3 - Import the dumps files

- Create a local git repository. `git init --bare MyRepoName && cd MyRepoName`
- Import the dumps. This also could take a few minutes. `cat ../temp/git-blob.dat ../temp/git-dump.dat | git fast-import`
- You are ready to go. The CVS repository is now a git repository.

## Step 4 - Push to remote Gitlab/Github account

- Create a repo on Gitlab or Github and follow the instructions for pushing the repository if some instructions are shown. For example:

  ```bash
  git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:some_group/some_repo_name.git
  git push -u origin --all
  git push -u origin --tags
  ```

## Conclusion

After some minutes or hours of migration, the complete CVS history is shown on the git repository of the project. Thanks to Michael Haggerty for creating this amazing tool.
