## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to setup a minimal working chroot jail restricting some user logging in via SSH to just the login shell.

Besides having an already installed and running SSH server we will start from scratch.

**Prerequisites**

* SSH service based on OpenSSH installed

## Step 1 - Provide chroot environment

### Step 1.1 - Minimal setup

All binaries that shall be executed in the chroot environment along with their dependencies on the shared linked objects must be part of the chroot environment.

First create a new directory which will be root for the chroot environment. For this tutorial the directory `/chroot-jail-root` will be used. As the login shell is minimal required it must be copied at least.

```bash=sh
mkdir -p /chroot-jail-root/usr/bin && cp /usr/bin/bash /chroot-jail-root/usr/bin/bash
```

When you try to chroot into this directory you will see an error saying that `bin/bash` is not found. In reality the binary exists but required libraries are not yet part of the chroot environment.

`ldd` does the job of printing the dependencies:

* Archlinux:

```bash=sh
$ ldd /usr/bin/bash
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffeeddfc000)
	libreadline.so.8 => /usr/lib/libreadline.so.8 (0x00007f806dfb9000)
	libdl.so.2 => /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f806dfb2000)
	libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f806dde5000)
	libncursesw.so.6 => /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6 (0x00007f806dd74000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f806e118000)
```

* Debian

```bash=sh
$ ldd /usr/bin/bash
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc6cfa4000)
	libtinfo.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 (0x00007f864f0f3000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f864f0ee000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f864ef2d000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f864f250000)
```

The `linux-vdso.so.1` is virtual so you can ignore this dependency.

So we create the directory for the library and copy the required shared object files into the newly created directory:

```bash=sh
mkdir -p /chroot-jail-root/usr/lib
ln -rs /chroot-jail-root/usr/lib /chroot-jail-root/lib
ln -rs /chroot-jail-root/usr/lib /chroot-jail-root/lib64
cp /usr/lib/libreadline.so.8 /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 /usr/lib/libc.so.6 /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6 /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /chroot-jail-root/usr/lib/
```

If you did everything correctly `chroot /chroot-jail-root/ /usr/bin/bash` should work now.

### Step 1.2 - Provide functionality of binaries

As the chroot command works now, we can provide some basic configuration and files which will be most likely required.

Copy minimal set of configuration files:

```
mkdir -p /chroot-jail-root/etc /chroot-jail-root/usr/share
cp /etc/{group,passwd,shadow,hosts} etc/
cp -r /usr/share/terminfo /chroot-jail-root/usr/share/
```

Other files that might be desired:

* `/etc/bash.bashrc`
* `/etc/inputrc`

Provide the special files in directories in `/dev`:

```
mkdir /chroot-jail-root/dev
mknod /chroot-jail-root/dev/null c 1 3
mknod /chroot-jail-root/dev/zero c 1 5
mknod /chroot-jail-root/dev/tty c 5 0
mknod /chroot-jail-root/dev/random c 1 8
mknod /chroot-jail-root/dev/urandom c 1 9
chmod 0666 /chroot-jail-root/dev/{null,tty,zero}
chown root:tty /chroot-jail-root/dev/tty
```

In case you want to translate the user and group ids into readable strings you will need to setup the [NSS](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html) by copying the following files into the chroot environment:

* `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
* `libnss_systemd.so`
* `libnss_files.so`
* `libcrypt.so`

Continue copying desired binaries and libraries.

You can copy `ldd` into the chroot to check binaries inside the chroot environment if all required shared object files are present.

Tip: Play around with `whoami` and `strace` (look out for `openat()` calls resulting in `ENOENT`) to identify the required files.

### Step 1.3 - Optional extensions to the chroot environment

Here are some ideas you could apply to the chroot environment, which won't be described within this tutorial but might give you a starting point for internet research:

* Maintain files within chroot environment by package manager
  * archlinux: `pacman --dbpath <db_path> --cachedir <cache_dir> --config <config_file> --root <chroot root directory>` where root is `/chroot-jail-root/` and all other files and directories are located outside of the chroot directory

## Step 2 - Create user

Create the user that shall jailed into the chroot environment.

The user name used in this tutorial will be called `prisoner` and use the bash as login shell.

Move or create the home directory of the `prisoner` user into the chroot environment.

```
mkdir -p /chroot-jail-root/home
useradd --base-dir /chroot-jail-root/home --create-home --shell /usr/bin/bash prisoner
```

Copy the changed `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group` into the chroot environment.

## Step 3 - Configure SSH to chroot

Edit the configuration `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` as required to jail a user, group, host, local address, local port, address.

For more details see `man sshd_config`.

```
Match User prisoner
    ChrootDirectory /chroot-jail-root
    PasswordAuthentication no
```

To apply the changes restart the sshd daemon or trigger a reload of the configuration.

```
systemctl reload sshd.service
```

### Step 4 - Configure SSH login (Optional)

We want to allow the `prisoner` user to login with a SSH key, as SSH employs a strict check of the access level to `~/.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file, make sure to set comply with the rules (`.ssh` owned by the user and `authorized_keys` file only readable (and writable) for the user).

```
su prisoner
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
exit
```

Copy the desired public keys into the `authorized_keys` file (absolute path is `/chroot-jail-root/home/prisoner/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
