## Introduction

In this tutorial we will set up a HashiCorp [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster with [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service and node discovery. With 3 server nodes and a custom amount of client nodes this should serve as a basis for growing projects. We will also create a hetzner cloud snapshot for our clients that enables us to add further clients without any manual setup.
The cluster will run on a private network between the servers and supports all out of the box features of Nomad and Consul, like service discovery and volumes.

> This tutorial follows in part the recommended steps from the official [Consul deployment guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/deployment-guide) and [Nomad deployment guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/production-deployment-guide-vm-with-consul).

**Prerequisites**

* A [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) account
* Basic knowledge of linux commands and the shell
* The ability to connect to a server with `ssh`

*This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Hetzner Cloud servers with Nomad 1.1.3 and Consul 1.10.1*

### Terminology and Notation

*Commands*

```bash
local$ <command>  # This command must be executed on your local machine
server$ <command> # This command must be executed on the server as root
```

## Step 1 - Create the base image

In this step the following resource will be used

* 1 Hetzner cloud CX11 server

We will start by setting up a Consul / Nomad server on a new CX11 cloud server. The resulting snapshot will serve as the base image for all cluster servers and clients in the following steps.

> This guide will show the setup for 3 servers. This will make the cluster highly-available, but not too expensive. Single server setups are not recommended, but possible. The tutorial will include comments on what to change for only 1 or more than 3 servers in the respective steps.

Go to the Hetzner cloud web interface and create a new CX11 server with Ubuntu 20.04.

### Step 1.1 - Update the server and install needed packages

To make sure everything is up-to-date, you should update the servers after creation. Connect to your server over ssh and run

```bash
server$ apt update
server$ apt upgrade
```

Now we can install `unzip`

```bash
server$ apt install unzip
```

For the following steps, make sure to be in the `/root/` folder

```bash
server$ cd /root/
```

### Step 1.2 - Install the Consul binary

To install HashiCorp Consul, we need to download and install the respective binary. First, define the version and host in an environment variable

```bash
server$ export CONSUL_VERSION="1.10.1"
server$ export CONSUL_URL="https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul"
```

> You can use the latest available version found on the [official website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/downloads). Changing the CONSUL_VERSION variable is sufficient.

Download the binary, decompress it and install it on your server

```bash
server$ curl --silent --remote-name ${CONSUL_URL}/${CONSUL_VERSION}/consul_${CONSUL_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
server$ unzip consul_${CONSUL_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
server$ chown root:root consul
server$ mv consul /usr/local/bin/
server$ rm consul_${CONSUL_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
```

We can now add autocomplete functionality for Consul (optional)

```bash
server$ consul -autocomplete-install
server$ complete -C /usr/local/bin/consul consul
```

Create a user for Consul

```bash
server$ useradd --system --home /etc/consul.d --shell /bin/false consul
server$ mkdir --parents /opt/consul
server$ chown --recursive consul:consul /opt/consul
```

Prepare the Consul configuration

```bash
server$ mkdir --parents /etc/consul.d
server$ touch /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
server$ chown --recursive consul:consul /etc/consul.d
server$ chmod 640 /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
```

Prepare the TLS certificates for Consul

```bash
server$ consul tls ca create
server$ consul tls cert create -server -dc dc1
server$ consul tls cert create -server -dc dc1
server$ consul tls cert create -server -dc dc1
server$ consul tls cert create -client -dc dc1
```

> If you want to run more or less than 3 Consul cluster servers, adapt the repetitions of `consul tls cert create -server -dc dc1`. For one cluster server, you only need to create one, for 5 servers you need 5 certificates.

This creates 3 server certificate and one client certificate. The `/root/` folder should now contain at least the following files

```console
server$ ls
consul-agent-ca.pem
consul-agent-ca-key.pem
dc1-server-consul-0.pem
dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem
dc1-server-consul-1.pem
dc1-server-consul-1-key.pem
dc1-server-consul-2.pem
dc1-server-consul-2-key.pem
dc1-client-consul-0.pem
dc1-client-consul-0-key.pem
```

### Step 1.3 - Install the Nomad binary

Similar to the Consul binary, we first define the version as a variable

```bash
server$ export NOMAD_VERSION="1.1.3"
```

> You can use the latest available version found on the [official website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/downloads). Changing the NOMAD_VERSION variable is sufficient.

Download and install the binary

```bash
server$ curl --silent --remote-name https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad/${NOMAD_VERSION}/nomad_${NOMAD_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
server$ unzip nomad_${NOMAD_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
server$ chown root:root nomad
server$ mv nomad /usr/local/bin/
server$ rm nomad_${NOMAD_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip
```

Add autocomplete functionality to nomad (optional)

```bash
server$ nomad -autocomplete-install
server$ complete -C /usr/local/bin/nomad nomad
```

Prepare the data directory

```bash
server$ mkdir --parents /opt/nomad
```

Create the basic configuration file for nomad

```bash
server$ mkdir --parents /etc/nomad.d
server$ chmod 700 /etc/nomad.d
server$ touch /etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl
```

Add the following configuration in the file `/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl`

```config
datacenter = "dc1"
data_dir = "/opt/nomad"
```

### Step 1.4 - Prepare the systemd services

Consul and Nomad should start automatically after boot. To enable this, create a systemd service for both of them.

Add the configuration file `/etc/systemd/system/consul.service` with the following content

```config
[Unit]
Description="HashiCorp Consul - A service mesh solution"
Documentation=https://www.consul.io/
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
ConditionFileNotEmpty=/etc/consul.d/consul.hcl

[Service]
Type=exec
User=consul
Group=consul
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/consul agent -config-dir=/etc/consul.d/
ExecReload=/bin/kill --signal HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
KillSignal=SIGTERM
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

and the configuration file `/etc/systemd/system/nomad.service` with the content

```config
[Unit]
Description=Nomad
Documentation=https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nomad agent -config /etc/nomad.d
KillMode=process
KillSignal=SIGINT
LimitNOFILE=infinity
LimitNPROC=infinity
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
StartLimitBurst=3
StartLimitIntervalSec=10
TasksMax=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Don't enable these services yet, since the setup is not complete.

### Step 1.5 - Create the base snapshot

Finally, stop the server in the Hetzner cloud web interface and create a snapshot. This snapshot will be used as a foundation for the server and client setup of the cluster.

After the snapshot creation was successful, delete the CX11 instance of this step.

## Step 2 - Set up the cluster servers

In this step you will create 3 cluster servers from the base image created in Step 1. These servers are the foundation of your cluster and will dynamically elect a cluster leader.

The cloud servers used in this step will be part of the final cluster, so make sure to schedule them in the right project and choose good names, since changing the name later is not easy.

We will use the following resources

* 1 Hetzner cloud network
* 3 Hetzner cloud CX11 server

In the Hetzner cloud web interface, create 3 CX11 servers from the snapshot created in Step 1 and a common cloud network attached. This tutorial will use a `10.0.0.0/8` network, but smaller networks work as well.

In the following steps, the tutorial will refer to the servers by their internal IP addresses `10.0.0.2`, `10.0.0.3` and `10.0.0.4`. If your servers have different internal addresses, make sure to replace them in the following steps.

> If you plan to only run a single cluster server, one cloud server is enough in this step. You still need the cloud network, since it will be used by the clients as well.

### Step 2.1 - Create the symmetric encryption key

First, create a symmetric encryption key, which will be shared between all servers. Save this key in a secure location, we will need it in the next steps.

On one of the servers run

```bash
server$ consul keygen
```

### Step 2.2 - Distribute the certificates

Now we can copy the right certificates from step 1 to the Consul configuration directory. Run the following command on all servers

```bash
server$ cp consul-agent-ca.pem /etc/consul.d/
```

The 3 certificates created in step 1 need to be distributed, so that every server gets a unique certificate with matching key. This tutorial will copy `dc1-server-consul-0*` on the server `10.0.0.2` into the folder `/etc/consul.d/`. Similar, copy `dc1-server-consul-1*` on `10.0.0.3` and `dc1-server-consul-2*` on `10.0.0.4`.

To check if you have all the files you need, you should get a similar output for your servers (X being the respective certificate number)

```console
server$ ls /etc/consul.d/
consul-agent-ca.pem
consul.hcl
dc1-server-consul-X-key.pem
dc1-server-consul-X.pem
```

Finally, delete all cert files and keys in your root directory on every server

```bash
server$ cd /root/
server$ rm *.pem
```

### Step 2.3 - Edit Consul base configuration

On all servers, edit the configuration file `/etc/consul.d/consul.hcl` and add the content

```config
datacenter = "dc1"
data_dir = "/opt/consul"
encrypt = "your-symmetric-encryption-key"
ca_file = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent-ca.pem"
cert_file = "/etc/consul.d/dc1-server-consul-0.pem"
key_file = "/etc/consul.d/dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem"
verify_incoming = true
verify_outgoing = true
verify_server_hostname = true
retry_join = ["10.0.0.2"]
bind_addr = "{{ GetPrivateInterfaces | include \"network\" \"10.0.0.0/8\" | attr \"address\" }}"

acl = {
  enabled = true
  default_policy = "allow"
  enable_token_persistence = true
}

performance {
  raft_multiplier = 1
}
```

Replace the `encrypt` parameter with your previously generated key on all servers and replace `cert_file` and `key_file` with the respective file names on each server.

`retry_join` should contain at least one of your servers internal IP adresses. If you don't use `10.0.0.0/8` as your private network, replace this part in the `bind_addr` parameter as well.

Check the configuration with the command

```bash
server$ consul validate /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
```

### Step 2.4 - Create Consul server configuration

On all servers, create the configuration file `/etc/consul.d/server.hcl` with the following content

```config
server = true
bootstrap_expect = 3
```

> Change the `bootstrap_expect` value to match the amount of servers you want to run. This value should be the same on all servers.

### Step 2.5 - Set up the Nomad servers

In this tutorial every Consul server will also act as a Nomad server.

Create the configuration file `/etc/nomad.d/server.hcl` with the content

```config
server {
  enabled = true
  bootstrap_expect = 3
}

acl {
  enabled = true
}
```

> Change the `bootstrap_expect` value to match the amount of servers you want to run. This value should again be the same on all servers.

### Step 2.6 - Start the cluster

If everything was configured correctly, you can now start the cluster.

Enable both services on all servers

```bash
server$ systemctl enable consul
server$ systemctl enable nomad
```

and start the services

```bash
server$ systemctl start consul
server$ systemctl start nomad
```

If everything went well, you should now have your cluster up and running. Wait up to 30 seconds for the servers to sync and elect a leader.

To check the cluster, run the following command on one of your servers

```console
server$ consul members
...
```

This should give you a list of all 3 servers.

Since we use ACLs (Access Control Lists) on Nomad, we have to get the bootstrap token first, before checking the status here as well.

Display the bootstrap token on one of the servers

```bash
server$ nomad acl bootstrap
```

> This command only works once. Make sure to save the acl token in a secure location.

This gives you the `Secret ID` used for all Nomad requests. With that copied, create a variable with your secret ID

```bash
server$ export NOMAD_TOKEN="your-secret-id"
```

and check the status of the Nomad cluster

```bash
server$ nomad server members
```

Similar to Consul, you should get a list of all servers.

## Step 3 - Create the client image

In this step you will set up a client. The snapshot will serve as an image for easy deployment of multiple clients.

We will use the following resources

* 1 Hetzner cloud CX11 server

In the Hetzner cloud web interface, create 1 CX11 servers from the snapshot created in step 1. The cloud server name is not important in this step, since we will only prepare the image on it.

### Step 3.1 - Configure Consul

Similar to the server configuration, we have to copy the certificate to the `/etc/consul.d/` folder.

Run the following commands on the cloud server

```bash
server$ cd /root/
server$ cp consul-agent-ca.pem /etc/consul.d/
server$ cp dc1-client-consul-0* /etc/consul.d/
server$ rm *.pem
```

Open the configuration file `/etc/consul.d/consul.hcl` and add the content

```config
datacenter = "dc1"
data_dir = "/opt/consul"
encrypt = "your-symmetric-encryption-key"
ca_file = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent-ca.pem"
cert_file = "/etc/consul.d/dc1-client-consul-0.pem"
key_file = "/etc/consul.d/dc1-client-consul-0-key.pem"
verify_incoming = true
verify_outgoing = true
verify_server_hostname = true
retry_join = ["10.0.0.2"]
bind_addr = "{{ GetPrivateInterfaces | include \"network\" \"10.0.0.0/8\" | attr \"address\" }}"

check_update_interval = "0s"

acl = {
  enabled = true
  default_policy = "allow"
  enable_token_persistence = true
}

performance {
  raft_multiplier = 1
}
```

Make sure to replace the `encrypt` parameter with your encryption key. If you don't use `10.0.0.0/8` as your private network, replace this part in the `bind_addr` parameter as well.

### Step 3.2 - Configure Nomad

Nomad has to be configured as well. For that, add the configuration file `/etc/nomad.d/client.hcl` with the content

```config
client {
  enabled = true

  network_interface = "{{ GetPrivateInterfaces | include \"network\" \"10.0.0.0/8\" | attr \"name\" }}"
}

acl {
  enabled = true
}
```

If you don't use `10.0.0.0/8` as your private network, replace this part in the `network_interface` parameter.

### Step 3.3 - Enable systemd services for Consul and Nomad

To make the snapshot as small as possible, we will only enable the services, but won't start them yet.

```bash
server$ systemctl enable consul
server$ systemctl enable nomad
```

### Step 3.4 - Create the snapshot

Go to the Hetzner cloud web interface, stop the server and create a snapshot. This snapshot will be used for all clients, so choose a meaningful name. You can delete the cloud server after the snapshot creation was successful.

> If you want to update this image later, create a cloud server from the snapshot, but without any cloud network attached. This way both Consul and Nomad will fail and won't sync any data, resulting in a smaller image.

## Step 4 - Adding clients

To add a client, start a cloud server from the snapshot created in step 3. Make sure to attach the cloud server to the private cloud network also used by the servers from step 2. Keep in mind that the cloud server name will be used in the cluster.

Startup may take up to a minute for the client to join the network. You can check the status on any node in the cluster with

```bash
server$ consul members
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations to your own, highly-available Nomad cluster on Hetzner cloud servers. You are ready to deploy your applications or add more functionality like reverse proxies, auto-scaling or HashiCorp Vault to store your secrets in. Make sure to also properly secure the cluster with firewalls and custom ACL tokens.
