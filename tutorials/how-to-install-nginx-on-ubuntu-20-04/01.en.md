## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to setup a ubuntu server. This includes how to create a non-root user, enable SSH login, disable root login and enabling a rudimentary firewall.


The first paragraph or paragraphs are there for you to explain what your tutorial will do. Please don't simply list the steps you will be following, a table of contents (TOC) with the steps will be automatically added.
Make sure users know exactly what they will end up with if they follow your tutorial, and let them know if they need any specific prerequisites.
You can link to other tutorials that your tutorial builds on, and add recommendations for what users should know.

**Prerequisites**

* [Setup Ubuntu 20.04](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/setup-ubuntu-20-04)


Example terminology that you can use in the tutorial:

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

## Step 1 - Login to server

Now login to your server with your non-root user:

```shell
ssh holu@10.0.0.1
```

## Step 1.1 - Update your server

After a successful login, we need to update our server. 

For this we run the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Step 2 - Install Nginx

We will install ```Nginx``` with the help of ```apt```.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt install nginx
```

## Step 3 - Updating the firewall

In the previous tutorial we set up a firewall, which blocks all connections except the ones from ```OpenSSH```.

Now, to be able to use ```Nginx``` we need to allow it within the firewall.

## Step 3.1 - List available ufw applications

To know what to activate within ```ufw``` we will first list all available applications, which we could enable.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw app list
```

This will propably lead to the following output:
```shell
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

- ```Nginx HTTP``` will only allow http traffic and will open for this port 80.
- ```Nginx HTTPS``` will only allow https traffic and will open for this port 443.
- ```Nginx Full``` will allow both http and https traffic and will open port 80 and 443.

You should only allow the most restrictive option for production. But we are still testing things out and haven't setup yet ```SSL``` therefore we will choose the option ```Nginx HTTP```.

## Step 3.2 - Adapt the ufw configuration

Run the following command and set your individual option:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

Confirm your changes by running the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw status
```

It should output the following:

```shell
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

## Step 4 - Check Nginx

Now that the firewall allows ```HTTP``` connections to ```Nginx``` we can check if everything works correct.

For this we're going to check the status of ```Nginx``` with the ```systemd``` service:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ systemctl status nginx
```

And if everything worked out correct, this should be your output:

```shell
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2021-08-21 17:54:37 CEST; 21min ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
   Main PID: 6370 (nginx)
      Tasks: 2 (limit: 2280)
     Memory: 4.1M
     CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
             ├─6370 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
             └─6371 nginx: worker process
```

We can also verify the status by navigating to our ```IP``` adress in the browser:

```
http://10.0.0.1
```

You should be greeted by the following message:

![Welcome to Nginx!](./welcome-to-nginx.png)

## Step 5 - Configuring a website

Now, we are going to configure a test website and point a our domain ```example.com``` to it.

## Step 5.1 - Create the content directory

The content for ```Nginx``` can be found here: ```/var/www/```.

Currently there is only the ```html``` directory which contains the webpage we just saw.

Now we are going to create a directory for ```example.com```.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
```

Before continuing we need to verify that our new directory has the right permissions. We do this with the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```

## Step 5.2 - Create a sample website

After creating the directory we are going to create a simple ```index.html```:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
```

Insert the following sample content or create your own message!

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is our test website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, holu!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 5.3 - Configure Nginx Server Block

Now that we have our website ready we need to create a so called ```Server Block``` which tells ```Nginx``` where to point requests for our server to.

For this we are creating a new file within the ```/etc/nginx/sites-available``` directory:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
```

And the following basic configuration and adapt it to your directory and domain:

```config
server {
  listen 80;

  server_name example.com;

  root /var/www/example.com/html;
  index index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }
}
```

>You can find other example configurations [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/).
## Step 5.4 - Activate the Server Block

To enable the Server Block we need to create a link of the file which points at ```/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

## Step 5.5 - Adjust the server_names_hash_bucket_size

A good explanaition to this problem can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/muhammadghazali/6c2b8c80d5528e3118613746e0041263).

To circumvent it we need to adjust the ```nginx.conf```:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Find the following line:

```config
# server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

And uncomment it. It should look like this now:

```config
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

## Step 5.5 - Test Nginx configuration

Now, that all necessary changes were made we can test our ```Nginx``` configuration.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nginx -t
```

If your output looks as following you did everything right!

```shell
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

## Step 5.6 - Reload Nginx

After confirming our setup of ```Nginx``` we can now reload it and make our changes active.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

We con now visit our new website. Browse in your Browser to ```http://example.com``` and you should see our simple test website.
