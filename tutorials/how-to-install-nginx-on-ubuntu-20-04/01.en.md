## Introduction

In this tutorial I'm going to cover how to install `Nginx` on an Ubuntu 20.04 server. Additionally I'm going to setup a simple website and create the configuration within `Nginx` to make the website available.

**Prerequisites**

* [Setup Ubuntu 20.04](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/setup-ubuntu-20-04)
* A domain name, e.g. `example.com` with an `A` and optionaly an `AAAA` DNS record pointing to your server. 

**Example terminology**

* Username: holu
* IPv4: 10.0.0.1
* Domain: example.com

Please replace `holu` with an own username, `10.0.0.1` with your own IP address and `example.com` with your own domain in all example commands.

## Step 1 - Login to server

Login to your server using a user with sudo privileges:

```shell
ssh holu@10.0.0.1
```

### Step 1.1 - Update your server

After a successful login, we need to update our server.

For this we run the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Step 2 - Install Nginx

We will install `Nginx` with the help of `apt`.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt install nginx
```

## Step 3 - Update the firewall

In the previous tutorial we set up a firewall, which blocks all connections except the ones from `OpenSSH`.

Now, to be able to use `Nginx` we need to allow it within the firewall.

### Step 3.1 - List available ufw applications

To know what to activate within `ufw` we will first list all available applications, which we could enable.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw app list
```

This will lead to the following output:

```
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

- `Nginx HTTP` will only allow `HTTP` traffic and will open for this port `80`.
- `Nginx HTTPS` will only allow `HTTPS` traffic and will open for this port `443`.
- `Nginx Full` will allow both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` traffic and will open port `80` and `443`.

You should only allow the most restrictive option for production.
As we are still testing things out and haven't setup `SSL` yet, we will choose  `Nginx HTTP`.

### Step 3.2 - Adapt the ufw configuration

To tell `ufw` that it should allow all `HTTP` traffic we need to run the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

Confirm your changes by running the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw status
```

It should output the following:

```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

## Step 4 - Check Nginx

Now that the firewall allows `HTTP` connections to `Nginx` we can check if everything works correct.

For this we're going to check the status of `Nginx` with the `systemd` service:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ systemctl status nginx
```

And if everything worked out correct, this should be your output:

```
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2021-08-21 17:54:37 CEST; 21min ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
   Main PID: 6370 (nginx)
      Tasks: 2 (limit: 2280)
     Memory: 4.1M
     CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
             ├─6370 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
             └─6371 nginx: worker process
```

We can also verify the status by navigating to our IP address in the browser: `http://10.0.0.1`.

You should be greeted by the following message:

![Welcome to Nginx!](images/welcome-to-nginx.png)

## Step 5 - Configure a website

Now, we are going to configure a test website and point our domain `example.com` to it.

### Step 5.1 - Create the content directory

The content which will be provided by `Nginx` can be found here: `/var/www/`.

Currently there is only the `html` directory which contains the webpage we just saw.

For our new website we are going to create a new directory.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
```

Before continuing we need to verify that our new directory has the right permissions. We do this with the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```

### Step 5.2 - Create a sample website

After creating the directory we are going to create a simple `index.html`:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
```

Insert the following sample content or create your own message!

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is our test website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, holu!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 5.3 - Configure Nginx Server Block

Now that we have our website ready we need to create a so called `Server Block` which tells `Nginx` where to point requests for our server to.

For this we are creating a new file within the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
```

Add the following basic configuration and adapt it to your directory and domain:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

> You can find other example configurations [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/).

### Step 5.4 - Activate the Server Block

To enable the `Server Block` we need to create a link in the directory `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` which points to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### Step 5.5 - Adjust the server_names_hash_bucket_size

A good explanation for this problem can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/muhammadghazali/6c2b8c80d5528e3118613746e0041263).

To circumvent it we need to adjust the `nginx.conf`:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Find the following line:

```nginx
# server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

And uncomment it. It should look like this now:

```nginx
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

### Step 5.6 - Test Nginx configuration

Now, that all necessary changes were made we can test our `Nginx` configuration.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nginx -t
```

If your output looks as following you did everything right!

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### Step 5.7 - Reload Nginx

After confirming our setup of `Nginx` we can now reload it and make our changes active.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

We can now visit our new website. Open `http://example.com` in your browser and you should see our simple test website.

## Conclusion

We were able to install `Nginx` and configure it to point to our new website.
