## Introduction

In this tutorial I'm going to cover how to install ```Nginx``` on an Ubuntu 20.04 server. Additionally I'm going to setup a simple website and create the configuration within ```Nginx``` to make the website available.

**Prerequisites**

* [Setup Ubuntu 20.04](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/setup-ubuntu-20-04)
* A top-level domain, e.g. ```example.com```

## Step 1 - Login to server

Login to your server using a user with sudo privileges:

```shell
ssh holu@10.0.0.11
```

### Step 1.1 - Update your server

After a successful login, we need to update our server.

For this we run the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Step 2 - Install Nginx

We will install ```Nginx``` with the help of ```apt```.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo apt install nginx
```

## Step 3 - Update the firewall

In the previous tutorial we set up a firewall, which blocks all connections except the ones from ```OpenSSH```.

Now, to be able to use ```Nginx``` we need to allow it within the firewall.

### Step 3.1 - List available ufw applications

To know what to activate within ```ufw``` we will first list all available applications, which we could enable.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw app list
```

This will lead to the following output:

```shell
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

- ```Nginx HTTP``` will only allow ```HTTP``` traffic and will open for this port ```80```.
- ```Nginx HTTPS``` will only allow ```HTTPS``` traffic and will open for this port ```443```.
- ```Nginx Full``` will allow both ```HTTP``` and ```HTTPS``` traffic and will open port ```80``` and ```443```.

You should only allow the most restrictive option for production.
As we are still testing things out and haven't setup ```SSL``` yet, we will choose  ```Nginx HTTP```.

### Step 3.2 - Adapt the ufw configuration

To tell ```ufw``` that it should allow all ```HTTP``` traffic we need to run the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

Confirm your changes by running the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw status
```

It should output the following:

```shell
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

## Step 4 - Check Nginx

Now that the firewall allows ```HTTP``` connections to ```Nginx``` we can check if everything works correct.

For this we're going to check the status of ```Nginx``` with the ```systemd``` service:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ systemctl status nginx
```

And if everything worked out correct, this should be your output:

```shell
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2021-08-21 17:54:37 CEST; 21min ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
   Main PID: 6370 (nginx)
      Tasks: 2 (limit: 2280)
     Memory: 4.1M
     CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
             ├─6370 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
             └─6371 nginx: worker process
```

We can also verify the status by navigating to our ```IP``` address in the browser:

```
http://10.0.0.1
```

You should be greeted by the following message:

![Welcome to Nginx!](./welcome-to-nginx.png)

## Step 5 - Configure a website

Now, we are going to configure a test website and point our domain ```example.com``` to it.

### Step 5.1 - Create the content directory

The content which will be provided by ```Nginx``` can be found here: ```/var/www/```.

Currently there is only the ```html``` directory which contains the webpage we just saw.

For our new website we are going to create a new directory.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
```

Before continuing we need to verify that our new directory has the right permissions. We do this with the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```

### Step 5.2 - Create a sample website

After creating the directory we are going to create a simple ```index.html```:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
```

Insert the following sample content or create your own message!

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is our test website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, holu!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 5.3 - Configure Nginx Server Block

Now that we have our website ready we need to create a so called ```Server Block``` which tells ```Nginx``` where to point requests for our server to.

For this we are creating a new file within the ```/etc/nginx/sites-available``` directory:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
```

Add the following basic configuration and adapt it to your directory and domain:

```config
server {
  listen 80;

  server_name example.com;

  root /var/www/example.com/html;
  index index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }
}
```

>You can find other example configurations [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/).

### Step 5.4 - Activate the Server Block

To enable the `Server Block` we need to create a link to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com` in the directory `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### Step 5.5 - Adjust the server_names_hash_bucket_size

A good explanation for this problem can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/muhammadghazali/6c2b8c80d5528e3118613746e0041263).

To circumvent it we need to adjust the ```nginx.conf```:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Find the following line:

```config
# server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

And uncomment it. It should look like this now:

```config
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

### Step 5.5 - Test Nginx configuration

Now, that all necessary changes were made we can test our ```Nginx``` configuration.

For this execute the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nginx -t
```

If your output looks as following you did everything right!

```shell
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### Step 5.6 - Reload Nginx

After confirming our setup of ```Nginx``` we can now reload it and make our changes active.

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

We con now visit our new website. Browse in your browser to ```http://example.com``` and you should see our simple test website.

## Conclusion

We were able to install ```Nginx``` and configure it to point to our new website.
