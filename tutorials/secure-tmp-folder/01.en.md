# Securing tmp Folder on Webserver on (for example Debian 9)

## Introduction

Often Webservers (or Hosting Subscriptions) are writing in tmp folder. Therefore its good to keep tmp folder clean and save. A good way to secure your tmp folder on a Linux Machine is to disallow script execution on tmp folder. I will show you how to check and secure your tmp folder. Please be aware that sometimes Server Control Panels need execution within the tmp folder.

**Prerequisites**

Regardless if you have some Server Control Panel installed, or you just using a custom Server with some Hosting, you will be able to secure tmp folder.

## Step 1 - Login to your Webserver!

Firstly login to your Server via SSH.

Be sure you have root permissions. 


## Step 2 - Check if a tmp folder already exists!

With following Command you can see if there's already a tmp folder:

```
# mount | egrep --color -w '^(tmpfs|/tmp)|/tmp'
```
Please copy the whole command except the # sign.

Output can be somthing like this "/filesystems/tmp_fs on /tmp type ext3 (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,data=ordered)"

If there is no such output, please continue. 

### Step 2 - Create a 4GB Partition:

Run the three commands one by one.

```
# mkdir /filesystems
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/filesystems/tmp_fs seek=2048 count=2048 bs=1M
# mkfs.ext3 /filesystems/tmp_fs

```

### Step 3 - Make sure your Partition will start with a reboot!

We will add the following code into "/etc/fstab".

Open fstab:

```
# nano /etc/fstab

```

Insert following, at the End of File:

```
# /filesystems/tmp_fs /tmp ext3 noexec,nosuid,loop 0 0

```

Save the File and continue.

### Step 4 - We will backup current TMP Folder with following commands!

```
# cd /
# cp -R /tmp /tmp_backup
```

### Step 5 - Now we have to mount our new tmp folder with noexec, nosuis, rw options!

```
# mount -o loop,noexec,nosuid,rw /filesystems/tmp_fs /tmp
```

And we will set some correct permissions:

```
# chmod 1777 /tmp
```

### Step 6 - We need to copy old files to new location!

```
# cp -R /tmp_backup/* /tmp/
# rm -rf /tmp_backup
```




### (Optional) Step 7 - Check tmp folder and try execution!

Check if new partition exists:

```
# df -h
# mount
```

Check if you can execute any script: 

```
# cp /bin/ls /tmp
# chmod 755 /tmp/ls
```

Run ls:

```
# /tmp/ls
```

If everything has worked, you now should get following output "Permission denied".

You can clean up with following command: 

```
# rm /tmp/ls
```

## Conclusion

Your webserver is now secured against bad Scripts and attacks on tmp Folder. If you have any Questions or Feedback, please feel free to contact me.
