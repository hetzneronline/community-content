## Introduction

The [installimage](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage) script in the [Hetzner Rescue System](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/troubleshooting/hetzner-rescue-system) provides an easy way to install various Linux distributions.

This tutorial shows how to use `installimage` to install an encrypted Ubuntu 22.04 system and add fully automated remote unlocking via clevis in initramfs stored in a separate `/boot` partition.

**Prerequisites**

* Hetzner account
* Two servers:
  * `tang-server` » Server with Ubuntu 22.04 installed
  * `clevis-server`/`rescue` » Server booted into the Rescue System
* No private networks attached on Hetzner Cloud

## Step 1 - Configure the tang server

At first we will install Tang and José (which is the c implementation of the JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption standards used by Tang) on the Server where Ubuntu 22.04 is installed already.

```shellsession
user@tang-server:~$ apt update 
user@tang-server:~$ apt install tang jose
user@tang-server:~$ systemctl enable tangd.socket
user@tang-server:~$ systemctl start tangd.socket
```

Execute `tang-show-keys` to check if everything is installed correctly and to determine the signing key’s fingerprint.

```shellsession
user@tang-server:~$ tang-show-keys 
3ZWS6-cDrCG61UPJS2BMmPU4I54
```

## Step 2 - Create or copy SSH public key to the clevis-server (Optional)

In order to log into the server remotely via an SSH key, we need to deposit the SSH key before the installation. If you do not have such a key, you need to generate one.

For example to generate an ed25519 SSH key run:

```shellsession
user@client:~$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Copy the public key to the rescue system of the clevis server, e.g. using `scp`:

```shellsession
user@client:~$ scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@<clevis-server>:/tmp/authorized_keys
```

If you have started the `Rescue System` with an existing SSH key, copy the public key for the installation:

```shellsession
root@rescue ~ # cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/authorized_keys
```

## Step 3 - Create or copy installimage config file

When `installimage` is called without any options, it starts in interactive mode and will open an editor after a distribution image has been selected. After exiting the editor, the installation will proceed and the corresponding configuration is saved as `/installimage.conf` in the installed system. In this tutorial we will pass such a configuration file to install directly.

Create a file `/tmp/setup.conf` with the following content or copy it to the server in the `Rescue System`.

Note: Replace `<secret>` with a secure password and adjust drive names and partitioning as needed.

```conf
CRYPTPASSWORD <secret>
DRIVE1 /dev/sda
BOOTLOADER grub
HOSTNAME host.example.com
PART /boot/efi esp 256M
PART /boot ext4 1G
PART /     ext4 all crypt
IMAGE /root/images/Ubuntu-2204-jammy-amd64-base.tar.gz
```

If an SSH-Key has been configured in Step 2, please also add the following line to `/tmp/setup.conf`.

```conf
SSHKEYS_URL /tmp/authorized_keys
```

## Step 4 - Create or copy post-install script

In order to automatically unlock the encrypted partition via the tang server, we need to install and add clevis to the initramfs which is stored on the unencrypted `/boot` partition. This will also trigger the inclusion of `dhclient` to configure networking, but without any extras. To enable support for Hetzner Cloud, we need to add a hook which includes support for RFC3442 routes.

In order to run these additional steps we need a post-install script for `installimage`.

Create a file `/tmp/post-install.sh` in the Rescue system with the following content.

Note: Replace `<secret>` with the password you set for the `CRYPTPASSWORD` value in the `/tmp/setup.conf` file, and replace `<ip-tangserver>` with the IP-address of your tang-server.

```bash
#!/bin/bash


add_rfc3442_hook() {
  cat << EOF > /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
#!/bin/sh

PREREQ=""

prereqs()
{
        echo "\$PREREQ"
}

case \$1 in
prereqs)
        prereqs
        exit 0
        ;;
esac

if [ ! -x /sbin/dhclient ]; then
        exit 0
fi

. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions
. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions

mkdir -p \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
cp -a /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/rfc3442-classless-routes \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
EOF

  chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
}


# Install hook
add_rfc3442_hook

# Update system
apt-get update >/dev/null

# Install clevis on the system and add clevis to the initramfs
apt-get -y install clevis clevis-luks clevis-initramfs cryptsetup-initramfs

# Get the key from the tang server and then bind the device to the tang server
curl -sfg http://<ip-tangserver>/adv -o /tmp/adv.jws
echo '<secret>' | clevis luks bind -d /dev/sda3 tang '{"url": "http://<ip-tangserver>" , "adv": "/tmp/adv.jws" }'

# Update the existing initramfs
update-initramfs -u
```

Important note: make the post-install script executable:

```shellsession
root@rescue ~ # chmod +x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

## Step 5 - Start installation

Before starting the installation check again the content of the following files:

* `/tmp/setup.conf` - installimage config
* `/tmp/post-install.sh` - is executable and contains the post-install script
* if configured in Step 2:
  * `/tmp/authorized_keys` - your public SSH key

Now you are ready to start the installation with the following command:

```shellsession
root@rescue ~ # installimage -a -c /tmp/setup.conf -x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

Wait until the installation completes and check `debug.txt` for any errors.

## Step 6 - Boot installed system

After the installation has finished and any errors are resolved, you can run `reboot` to restart the server and boot the newly installed system. You can watch the boot process if you have a KVM attached or via remote console on a Cloud instance.

## Conclusion

If you have followed all the steps in this tutorial, the clevis-server should automatically decrypt the root filesystem in initramfs and afterwards boot normally into the OS.
