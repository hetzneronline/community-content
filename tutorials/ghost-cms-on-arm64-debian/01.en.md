## Introduction

In this tutorial we will set up a Ghost CMS on a server with [Ampere Altra processors](https://amperecomputing.com/en/press/hetzner--first-european-hoster-with-ampere-altra-based-dedicated-servers). Running Ghost on Hetzner's CAX11 with Arm64 architecture, for example, will give you two vCPUs and 4GB RAM - a very high-performance Ghost installation, with capacity for additional applications.

**We will cover:**

1. Creating the local user `ghostadmin`
2. Installing Docker from official repositories
3. Launching Ghost and MySQL in Docker containers using Docker Compose
4. Configuring nginx as web server and reverse proxy
5. Enabling HTTPS / SSL using Certbot in a Snap package
6. Activating the UFW Uncomplicated Firewall 

**Prerequisites**

* A server with Arm64 architecture and Debian 11 (e.g. Hetzner Cloud CAX11).
* A connection to the server over SSH as root.
* A domain name with a DNS A-record pointing to the IP address of your server.
* Updated Debian 11 Linux with packages `install, ca-certificates, curl, gnupg, ufw, joe, snapd and nginx`

  
  ```bash
  apt update ; apt upgrade
  apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg ufw joe snapd nginx
  install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  ```

<br>

**Example terminology**

* Domain name: `example.com`

## Step 1 - Create local user ghostadmin

In this step we create the local user `ghostadmin` and assign it to the group sudo so that we can execute commands as root with the sudo command.

```bash
adduser ghostadmin
usermod -aG sudo ghostadmin
```

Logout `root` and log back in over SSH as user `ghostadmin`. 

We can also use `su - ghostadmin` to switch to the new user without having to log out and back in again. 

## Step 2 - Install Docker

We will be running Ghost and MySQL in Docker containers, with a standard install of nginx as reverse proxy and web server. In this step we install the Community Edition (CE) of Docker from official repositories.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg 

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

To verify that everything is OK with our Docker installation use:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

You should see this:

```console
ghostadmin@debian-arm64:~# sudo docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

Now we need to add our user `ghostadmin` to the docker group so that we can run the `docker` command without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ghostadmin
```

Update group membership for user `ghostadmin` by logging out and logging back in again.

## Step 3 - Launch Ghost and MySQL in Docker

In this step we create a `docker-compose.yml` file which launches Ghost and MySQL 8 in Docker containers.

Create `docker-compose.yml` in a new directory `ghostcms` in our home directory - `/home/ghostadmin/ghostcms`:

```bash
mkdir ghostcms ; cd ghostcms
joe docker-compose.yml  #or your favourite editor
```

In the docker-compose.yml file below note:

- the `volumes:` section where `/var/lib/ghost/content` maps to a folder in your $HOME directory, ex `/home/ghostadmin/ghostcms/content`. 

This is where Ghost will store media, configuration files and themes. You must create this empty directory.
- the `LongAndComplexRootPassword` must be the same in `ghost` and `db` sections.
- edit `url: https://example.com` to match your domain name.

Here's the Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
 
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:5-alpine
    restart: always
    ports:
      -  2368:2368
    expose:
      - 2368
    environment:
      database__connection__host: db
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: LongAndComplexRootPassword
      database__connection__database: ghost
      url: https://example.com
    links:
      -  db
    volumes:
      -  /home/ghostadmin/ghostcms/content:/var/lib/ghost/content
    depends_on:
      -  db
  db:
    image: arm64v8/mysql:8
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: LongAndComplexRootPassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ghost
      MYSQL_USER: ghost
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: GhostUserPassword
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
 
volumes:
  mysql-data:
  ghost-data:
```

Now we can launch Ghost and MySQL in Docker containers and daemonize ( the `-d` option, run in background ) with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check that everything is OK with `docker ps`. You should see something like this:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES
4ae328d5281a   ghost:5-alpine    "docker-entrypoint.s…"   1 minute ago   Up 1 minute   0.0.0.0:2368->2368/tcp, :::2368->2368/tcp   ghost-docker-ghost-1
c47c72ae2adb   arm64v8/mysql:8   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   1 minute ago     Up 1 minute   3306/tcp, 33060/tcp                         ghost-docker-db-1
```

## Step 4 - Configure nginx as reverse proxy

In this step we set up a Nginx web server which will communicate with Ghost internally on port 2368 and make Ghost available over an encrypted HTTPS connection on port 443.


```bash
cd /etc/nginx
sudo rm sites-enabled/default
sudo rm sites-available/default
sudo joe sites-available/example.conf #use any editor...
```

Edit `server_name` to match your domain name. Certbot will add certificates for the HTTPS connection in the next step.

```nginx
server {

 # Port 80 initially, SSL will be enabled by Certbot

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com;

# Housekeeping

    server_tokens off;
    client_max_body_size 1g;

# Certbot stuff

   location ~ /.well-known {
        allow all;
    }
 
# Block evildoers

    location ~* \.(aspx|php|jsp|cgi)$
    {
      deny all;
    }

# Enable gzip compression

    gzip on;
    gzip_min_length 1000;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/javascript image/svg+xml;
    gzip_buffers 16 4k; 
    gzip_disable "msie6";
 
 # Reverse proxy to Ghost in docker running on port 2368
  
    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2368;
  
    }
 
}
```

This configuration is stored in the directory `sites-available` but must also be available in the directory `sites-enabled`. So we create a symbolic link to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` using this command:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Check that everything is OK and reload nginx with these two commands:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Ghost should now be available at http://example.com on port 80. Your browser may not allow non-HTTPS access on port 80, so we will generate an SSL certificate using Certbot.

## Step 5 - Enable SSL with Certbot

Certbot can provide [wildcard certificates for all domains](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=snap&tab=wildcard) under *.example.com, this involves creating two TXT records in your DNS domain admin. In this tutorial we will only create a certificate for a single domain.

Install Certbot as a Snap package with:

```bash
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

Run Certbot to create a certificate for example.com:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

If everything works out fine, you will find these lines added to the nginx configuration file example.conf and a new `server` section for port 80:

```bash
    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
```

You should now be able to access Ghost securely over HTTPS at https://example.com. Create an admin user at https://example.com/ghost and you're done!

## Step 6 - Post-installation security

* [Secure your SSH server](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-secure-ssh-connections-linux/) - disabling root logins, etc.

* Enable UFW Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow SSH  # Important, or you will be locked out of your server...
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a self-hosted Ghost blog up and running on a server with Arm64 architecture. If you want to send emails from your Ghost installation, add SMTP information in the `environment` section, and restart your Ghost Docker container.

```yaml
    environment:
      - mail__options__auth__pass=your_password
      - mail__options__auth__user=your_email
      - mail__options__host=smtp_host_address
      - mail__options__port=smtp_port_587
      - mail__options__secure=false
      - mail__options__service=name_for_service
      - mail__transport=SMTP
```
