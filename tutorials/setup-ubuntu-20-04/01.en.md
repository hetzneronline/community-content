## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to setup an Ubuntu server. This includes how to create a non-root user, enable SSH login, disable root login and enable a rudimentary firewall.

## Step 1 - Login to your new server

Login as the root user to your new Ubuntu 20.04 server:

```shell
ssh root@10.0.0.1
```

>If you already set up your server with an SSH key and it isn't your default key you need to tell your machine where to find it:

```shell
ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key root@10.0.0.1
```

## Step 2 - Create a new non-root user

It is recommended not to use a root user on a regular basis. Thus we will create a new non-root user.
In the future we will only use this user to log in.

Type this command to create a new user:

```shell
root@10.0.0.1:~$ adduser holu
```

Now you will be prompted to enter some information.
First, enter a strong password. The remaining information you can fill out or skip by pressing `ENTER`.

## Step 3 - Add new user to sudo group

Our new user has only regular account privileges. But as we are going to use it as our main user, we will sometimes need administrative privileges. To be able to run administrative commands as a non-root user we need to add our user to the **sudo** group.

For this still as the root user we will run this command:

```shell
root@10.0.0.1:~$ usermod -aG sudo holu
```

## Step 4 - Switch to the new user

Now log out of the root user with the following command:

```shell
root@10.0.0.1:~$  exit
```

Afterwards we can log in with our new user:

```shell
ssh holu@10.0.0.1
```

Now that we are logged in as a non-root user we need to use **sudo** in front of administrative commands.

## Step 5 - Enable a basic firewall

After creating a non-root user we want to enable the firewall. For this we will use `ufw`.

### Step 5.1 - List all available applications

First, we want to list all available applications which we can register with the firewall.

You can list them with the following command:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw app list
```

This will be the output:

```shell
Available applications:
  OpenSSH
```

### Step 5.2 - Allow OpenSSH

As we want to use `SSH` for future logins we need to enable it before we activate the firewall:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```

### Step 5.3 - Enable the firewall

Now, that the firewall allows `SSH` connections we can activate it:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo ufw enable
```

Next, check the status:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ ufw status
```

```shell
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

The firewall now blocks all connections except SSH.

>If we install new applications we need to activate them. Otherwise their connection will be blocked by the firewall.

## Step 6 - Add SSH keys

Create an SSH key pair on your local machine.

Now, copy the public key from your local machine to your server with the following command:

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/ssh_key.pub | ssh holu@10.0.0.1 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

- Replace `~/.ssh/ssh_key.pub` with the path to your public SSH key.
- Replace `holu` with your new username
- Replace 10.0.0.1 with the IP of your server.

## Step 7 - Edit the sshd config

Now, that we use `SSH` for our login we need to deactivate password based login and the login for the root user.

For this we will edit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Step 7.1 - Deactivate password based login

Within the file locate the following line:

```config
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

And change it to:

```config
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### Step 7.2 - Disable root login

Within the file locate the following line:
```config
PermitRootLogin yes
```

And change it to:
```config
PermitRootLogin no
```

### Step 7.3 - Restart sshd service

Save and close the editor.

Now restart the sshd service:

```shell
holu@10.0.0.1:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

## Step 8 - Create an SSH config (Optional)

>For Mac/Linux:

Create an `SSH` config on your local machine. Here we will tell our machine where to find our SSH key, so we don't have to specify it each time we login.

Run the following command on your local machine:

```shell
sudo nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add now the following content adapted to your SSH key:

```config
HOST 10.0.0.1
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/SSH-key
```

Now whenever you login to your server your machine looks up the correct SSH key.

## Conclusion

We have now a basic Ubuntu 20.04 server. We have created a non-root user, and enabled SSH login. Futhermore we disabled root login and activated the `ufw` firewall.
