## Introduction

Uptime Kuma is a free, open-source, and self-hosted monitoring tool designed to help you track the availability and performance of your websites, applications, and other services. Inspired by services like UptimeRobot, Uptime Kuma offers a powerful yet user-friendly interface, giving you full control over your monitoring needs.

In this tutorial I will introduce you to installing uptime kuma with Docker Compose on Portainer.

In this scenario, we will discuss the use and example monitoring of another server and website.

**Prerequisites**

* A server with Ubuntu Server installed and root access.
* [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) installed

**Example terminology**

Since the option to create users is up to you and this also applies to setting up hostnames, only example IP Addresses and Monitored Services are listed here.

* IP addresses and ports:
   * Portainer: `203.0.113.1:9443`
   * Uptime Kuma `203.0.113.1:3001`
* Monitored services:
   * MyServer01: `192.0.2.254`
   * MyWebsite01: `example.com`

## Step 1 - Preparing the server

For this example, I will use the pre-installed application in Hetzner Cloud — Docker CE.

![Selecting the server](images/selecting-server.png)

Once the server is installed, connect to SSH with root permissions.

Create a user with sudo privileges and add the new user to the Docker group.

I recommend to update Ubuntu packages before continuing.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

First, we create a volume that Portainer will use to store its data.

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

Use the command below to start the portainer on port 9443. This also opens port 8000, for unsecured HTTP.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:2.21.5
```

Now we access the server using our portainer address

```
https://203.0.113.1:9443
```

![First login to Portainer](images/first-login.png)

### Step 1.1 - Setting up Portainer

Once we are logged into our portainer, we will be presented with the Environment Wizard where we select `Get started`.

![Get started Portainer](images/portainer-get-started.png)

We choose our `local environment`.

![Selecting the environment](images/selecting-environment.png)

## Step 2 - Creating Uptime Kuma stack

In the left control panel of Portainer, select "Stacks". Then, in the upper right corner, select `Add Stack`.

The name can be any name, in our case `uptime-kuma`, the build method will be the default `Web editor` and we will insert the Docker Compose written below.

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  uptime-kuma:
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:1
    container_name: uptime-kuma
    volumes:
      - /docker-vol/uptime-kuma:/app/data # Here is a template for setting the directory /path/to/dir/uptime-kuma:/app/data
    ports:
      - 3001:3001
    restart: always
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

Once inserted, click on `Deploy the stack` at the very bottom.

## Step 3 - Accessing Uptime Kuma

We can now visit our Uptime Kuma on port 3001.

```
http://203.0.113.1:3001/setup
```

![Uptime Kuma login](images/uptime-kuma-login.png)

After logging in, we will see our Dashboard, which we will then describe. First, let's take a look at the settings of the application itself.

![Uptime Kuma Dashboard](images/uptime-kuma-dashboard.png)

In the top right corner, click on our profile icon and click on the `Settings` box.

In the `General` section we can configure the basic settings of the application, I recommend to set the correct time zone and if you want to connect Uptime Kuma to a domain later, the `Primary Base URL`, if we will use IP as in our case, we do not need to fill in anything, or click on `Auto Get`.

## Step 4 - Example monitoring

We'll take the example of monitoring another Ubuntu Server and Website.

Go back to the dashboard and click on `Add New Monitor` in the top left.

### Step 4.1 - Monitoring an Ubuntu server

Now we will see an example of monitoring another Ubuntu Server.

For example, you can monitor the server using ping, Uptime Kuma also offers a Push option which is more comprehensive. But we will demonstrate ping monitoring here.

![Uptime Kuma another Server monitoring](images/uptime-kuma-server-monitor.png)

### Step 4.2 - Monitoring a Website

Now we will see an example of Website.

For web page tracking, select the HTTP(s) tracking type.

![Uptime Kuma Website monitoring](images/uptime-kuma-website-monitor.png)

### Step 4.3 - Monitoring Settings

Here we will discuss the basic parameters that we can set for our monitors.

| Parameter          | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Friendly Name      | The name under which our monitoring can be found. |
| Heartbeat Interval | The interval at which the checks will take place. Default is 60 seconds. |
| Retries            | The number of failed checks before the service appears to have an outage. |

You can also select alerts for each monitor when it detects that the service is not running. There are many options to choose from, some of the most well-known include Email (SMTP), Discord, Telegram, Webhook.

## Step 5 - Creating a Status Page

Now we will describe how to create a Status page for our monitoring.

![Uptime Kuma creating Status Page](images/uptime-kuma-creating-status-page.png)

Click on `New Status Page`. Pick a name for the status page and enter a slug. After the status page is published, you can access it like this:

```
http://203.0.113.1:3001/status/<your_input>
```

After the page is created, we can set the title, icon, custom CSS and more. We can also click on `Add Monitor` where we can add previously created monitors.

![Uptime Kuma our Status Page setting](images/uptime-kuma-status-page-settings.png)

Now, if we click `Save`, our status page will be published and can be viewed by non-logged-in users.

```
http://203.0.113.1:3001/status/test
```

## Step 6 - Creating Maintenance

Another great tool is the ability to create maintenance. During maintenance, site monitoring will be paused and a banner will be displayed on the relevant status page with a maintenance notification, the affected views will be lit in blue.

Click on your profile icon in the top right, and click on "Maintenance". Now "Schedule Maintenance".

![Uptime Kuma creating Maintenance](images/uptime-kuma-creating-maintenance.png)

In the specific maintenance settings, a time window can be selected, everything from a specific time to a repeated interval or CRON is available.

Once created, just click `Save` and the maintenance will be created and active.

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial helped with setting up the status page. Uptime Kuma is very customizable and I believe you will quickly get used to and discover the magic of this monitoring tool yourself.

I have been using Uptime Kuma myself for over a year and have always relied on this tool.
