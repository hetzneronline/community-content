# Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud using a tool called "Claudie." Claudie is a platform for managing multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud Kubernetes clusters with support for 
nodepools across different cloud-providers and on-premise data centers, including Hetzner Cloud. 

**Prerequisites**
* Hetzner Cloud account
* kubectl binary
* Local Kind/Minikube cluster

# Step 1: Install Claudie
Claudie needs to be installed on an existing Kubernetes cluster, referred to as the Management Cluster, which is used to manage the clusters it provisions. For this tutorial, an ephemeral clusters like Minikube or Kind can be used for 
simplicity. This steps assumes that you have installed [KIND]( https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) locally.

> For testing, you can use ephemeral clusters like Minikube or Kind. However, for production environments, we recommend using a more resilient solution since Claudie maintains the state of the infrastructure it creates.

1. Create a KIND cluster and export the kubeconfig
```bash
➜  ~ kind create cluster --name claudie-mgmt
Creating cluster "claudie-mgmt" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.27.3) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
Set kubectl context to "kind-claudie-mgmt"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-claudie-mgmt

Thanks for using kind! 😊

➜  ~ kind get kubeconfig -n claudie-mgmt > ~/.kube/claudie
➜  ~ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/claudie
➜  ~ kubectl get nodes
NAME                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
claudie-mgmt-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   3m8s   v1.27.3
➜  ~
```

2. Install cert-manager as it is a requirement for the Claudie Management cluster.
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

3. Deploy Claudie
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/berops/claudie/releases/l/download/claudie.yaml
```

4. Wait for all Pods get into **Ready** state
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl -n claudie get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

# Step 2: Create Hetzner API Key
1. Login to your [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud) to generate a new API token with *Read & Write* permissions. For more information you can follow 
[this](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/) guide on creating an API Token.

2. Create a Kubernetes Secret that will contain the Hetzner API Token.
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl create secret generic hetzner-secret \
  --from-literal=credentials='YOUR_API_TOKEN'
secret/hetzner-secret created
```

# Step 3: Create a Claudie manifest file
Now, let's create a Claudie manifest file that describes the Kubernetes cluster you want to create on Hetzner. You can use this example manifest as a starting point:
```yaml
apiVersion: claudie.io/v1beta1
kind: InputManifest
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-hetzner
spec:
  providers:
      - name: hetzner-secret
        providerType: hetzner
        secretRef:
          name: hetzner-secret
          namespace: default
  nodePools:
    dynamic:
      - name: control-hetzner-1
        providerSpec:
          name: hetzner-secret
          region: fsn1
          zone: fsn1-dc14
        count: 1
        serverType: cpx21
        image: ubuntu-22.04

      - name: compute-hetzner-1
        providerSpec:
          name: hetzner-secret
          region: fsn1
          zone: fsn1-dc14
        count: 3
        serverType: cpx21
        image: ubuntu-22.04
        storageDiskSize: 50
  kubernetes:
    clusters:
      - name: hetzner-cluster
        version: v1.24.0
        network: 192.168.2.0/24
        pools:
          control:
            - control-hetzner-1
          compute:
            - compute-hetzner-1
```
The above manifest file is used for defining a Kubernetes cluster. Let's break down some of the key fields in it:
* `spec.providers` field contains configurations for supported cloud providers. It is referencing access credentials that were previously created in a *Secret* object.
* `spec.nodePools.dynamic` defines dynamic nodepools. Those are cloud provider VMs that Claudie is expected to create.
* `spec.kubernetes.clusters` describes the Kubernetes cluster that will be created.

Provided example is relatively simple and deploys a Kubernetes cluster with one control node and three worker nodes. However, Claudie can be used for more advanced cluster scenarios, including deploying clusters across different cloud providers 
and on-premise in multi-cloud/hybrid architecture. For more in-depth understanding of Claudie `inputmanifest` definition, visit the [documentation site](https://docs.claudie.io).

# Step 4: Deploy the cluster
Save the above example to an `inputmanifes.yml` file, and apply it to the Kind cluster.
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl apply -f input-manifest.yml
inputmanifest.claudie.io/kubernetes-hetzner created
```

Now you can follow the cluster deployment status. When the cluster will be deployed the status will state **DONE**.
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl get inputmanifest
NAME                 STATUS
kubernetes-hetzner   IN_PROGRESS

➜  ~ kubectl get inputmanifests
NAME                 STATUS
kubernetes-hetzner   DONE
```

# Step 5: Access the cluster

The *kubeconfig* will be saved to a Secret object in `claudie` namespace. 
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl get secrets -A
NAMESPACE      NAME                                      TYPE                            DATA   AGE
cert-manager   cert-manager-webhook-ca                   Opaque                          3      103m
claudie        claudie-webhook-certificate               kubernetes.io/tls               3      100m
claudie        dynamo-secret-td2bt2f272                  Opaque                          2      101m
claudie        hetzner-cluster-mgcdv9x-kubeconfig   Opaque                          1      12m
claudie        hetzner-cluster-mgcdv9x-metadata     Opaque                          1      12m
claudie        minio-secret-5hd7htgm7m                   Opaque                          2      101m
claudie        mongo-secret-gfc6d84tcf                   Opaque                          2      101m
default        hetzner-secret                            Opaque                          1      82m

➜  ~ kubectl get secrets -n claudie hetzner-cluster-mgcdv9x-kubeconfig -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: ...
    server: https://XX.XX.XX.XX:6443
  name: hetzner-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: hetzner-cluster
    user: kubernetes-admin
  name: kubernetes-admin@hetzner-cluster
current-context: kubernetes-admin@hetzner-cluster
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin
  user:
    client-certificate-data: ...
    client-key-data: ...

```

Confirm that the cluster is up and running:
```bash
➜  ~ kubectl get secrets -n claudie hetzner-cluster-mgcdv9x-kubeconfig -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d
 > ~/.kube/hetzner
➜  ~ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/hetzner
➜  ~ kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
compute-hetzner-1-cyxbuh6-1   Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.0
compute-hetzner-1-cyxbuh6-2   Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.0
compute-hetzner-1-cyxbuh6-3   Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.0
control-hetzner-1-ivfw0xn-1   Ready    <none>   20m   v1.24.0

```

# Conclusion
In this tutorial we walked through the process of deploying a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud using Claudie. We began by setting up Claudie in a local KIND cluster, created a Hetzner API key for authentication, and defined a Claudie manifest 
file. After applying the manifest, we successfully created a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud.
