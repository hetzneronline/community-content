## Introduction

This tutorial explains the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud using a tool called "[Claudie](https://docs.claudie.io/)". Claudie is a platform for managing multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud Kubernetes clusters with support for 
nodepools across different cloud-providers and on-premise data centers, including Hetzner Cloud. 

**Prerequisites**
* [Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud) account
* [kubectl binary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
* [*kind*](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start)
* Container runtime, e.g. [Docker](/tutorials/howto-docker-install)

## Step 1 - Install Claudie

Claudie needs to be installed on an existing Kubernetes cluster, referred to as the Management Cluster, which is used to manage the clusters it provisions. For this tutorial, an ephemeral cluster like *kind* can be used for simplicity. This step assumes that you have [*kind* installed](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start) locally.

> For testing, you can use ephemeral clusters like Minikube or *kind*. However, for production environments, it is recommended to use a more resilient solution since Claudie maintains the state of the infrastructure it creates.

1. Create a *kind* cluster and export the kubeconfig
   
   ```shellsession
   holu@<your_host>:~# kind create cluster --name claudie-mgmt
   Creating cluster "claudie-mgmt" ...
    ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.27.3) 🖼
    ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
    ✓ Writing configuration 📜
    ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
    ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
    ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
   Set kubectl context to "kind-claudie-mgmt"
   You can now use your cluster with:
   
   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-claudie-mgmt
   ```
   ```shellsession
   holu@<your_host>:~# kind get kubeconfig -n claudie-mgmt > ~/.kube/claudie
   holu@<your_host>:~# export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/claudie
   holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get nodes
   NAME                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
   claudie-mgmt-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   3m8s   v1.27.3
   ```

2. Install cert-manager as it is a requirement for the Claudie Management cluster.
   
   ```shellsession
   holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

3. Deploy Claudie
   
   ```shellsession
   holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/berops/claudie/releases/latest/download/claudie.yaml
   ```

4. Wait for all Pods to get into **Ready** state
   
   ```shellsession
    holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl -n claudie get pods
    NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

    terraformer-7c7bfffc4b-2wnqf        1/1     Running     0          90s
   ```

## Step 2 - Create Hetzner API Key

1. Login to your [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud) to generate a new API token with *Read & Write* permissions. For more information you can follow [this guide](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/) on creating an API Token.

2. Create a Kubernetes Secret that will contain the Hetzner API Token.
   
   ```shellsession
   holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl create secret generic hetzner-secret --from-literal=credentials='YOUR_API_TOKEN'
   ```

## Step 3 - Create a Claudie manifest file

Now, let's create a Claudie manifest file that describes the Kubernetes cluster you want to create on Hetzner. You can use the example manifest below as a starting point.

* Create the file:
  
  ```shellsession
  holu@<your_host>:~# nano inputmanifest.yml
  ```

* Add your content:
  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: claudie.io/v1beta1
  kind: InputManifest
  metadata:
    name: kubernetes-hetzner
  spec:
    providers:
      - name: hetzner-secret
        providerType: hetzner
        secretRef:
          name: hetzner-secret
          namespace: default
    nodePools:
      dynamic:
        - name: hetzner-ctrl
          providerSpec:
            name: hetzner-secret
            region: fsn1
            zone: fsn1-dc14
          count: 1
          serverType: cpx21
          image: ubuntu-22.04

        - name: hetzner-cmpt
          providerSpec:
            name: hetzner-secret
            region: fsn1
            zone: fsn1-dc14
          count: 3
          serverType: cpx21
          image: ubuntu-22.04
          storageDiskSize: 50
    kubernetes:
      clusters:
        - name: hetzner-cluster
          version: v1.30.0
          network: 192.168.2.0/24
          pools:
            control:
              - hetzner-ctrl
            compute:
              - hetzner-cmpt
  ```

The above manifest file is used for defining a Kubernetes cluster. Let's break down some of the key fields in it:

* `spec.providers` » Contains configurations for supported cloud providers. It is referencing access credentials (previously created in a *Secret* object) and terraform template files for Hetzner (see [more](https://github.com/berops/claudie-config))
* `spec.nodePools.dynamic` » Defines dynamic nodepools. Those are cloud provider VMs that Claudie is expected to create.
* `spec.kubernetes.clusters` » Describes the Kubernetes cluster that will be created.

Provided example is relatively simple and deploys a Kubernetes cluster with one control node and three worker nodes. However, Claudie can be used for more advanced cluster scenarios, including deploying clusters across different cloud providers 
and on-premise in multi-cloud/hybrid architecture. Additionally, it's worth noting that the nodes will be connected using a WireGuard network, eliminating the need for a virtual network resource. For more in-depth understanding of Claudie `inputmanifest` definition, visit the [documentation site](https://docs.claudie.io).

## Step 4 - Deploy the cluster

------

**Important:** Please note that applying the YAML file from above will automatically create:
* 4 Hetzner Cloud servers of type CPX21 that **will be charged**
* 3 Hetzner Cloud Volumes with a storage capacity of 50 GB each that **will be charged**
* 1 Hetzner Cloud Firewall (free)
* It will also add an SSH key to the project

------

Save the example above to an `inputmanifest.yml` file, and apply it to the *kind* cluster. If you are not prepared to pay for 4 servers of type CPX21 and 3 Volumes, you can adapt the YAML file above as needed before you run the following command:

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl apply -f inputmanifest.yml
inputmanifest.claudie.io/kubernetes-hetzner created
```

Now you can follow the cluster deployment status. When the cluster is deployed, the status will state **DONE**.

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get inputmanifest
NAME                 STATUS
kubernetes-hetzner   IN_PROGRESS

holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get inputmanifest
NAME                 STATUS
kubernetes-hetzner   DONE
```
## Step 5 - Access the cluster

The *kubeconfig* will be saved to a Secret object in the `claudie` namespace. 

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get secrets -A
NAMESPACE      NAME                                      TYPE                            DATA   AGE
cert-manager   cert-manager-webhook-ca              Opaque                          3      36m
claudie        claudie-webhook-certificate          kubernetes.io/tls               3      32m
claudie        dynamo-secret-6tffbf8bc7             Opaque                          2      32m
claudie        hetzner-cluster-b87z4jq-kubeconfig   Opaque                          1      57s
claudie        hetzner-cluster-b87z4jq-metadata     Opaque                          1      57s
claudie        minio-secret-6tffbf8bc7              Opaque                          2      32m
claudie        mongo-secret-k479ht772f              Opaque                          3      32m
default        hetzner-secret                       Opaque                          1      29m
kube-system    bootstrap-token-abcdef               bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token   6      37m
```

> Run the following command to obtain the kubeconfig of the built cluster

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get secrets -n claudie -l claudie.io/cluster=hetzner-cluster,claudie.io/output=kubeconfig -ojsonpath='{.items[0].data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <your_data>
    server: https://<203.0.113.1>:6443
  name: hetzner-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: hetzner-cluster
    user: kubernetes-admin
  name: kubernetes-admin@hetzner-cluster
current-context: kubernetes-admin@hetzner-cluster
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <your_data>
    client-key-data: <your_data>
```

Confirm that the cluster is up and running:

> By running the commands below you can store the kubeconfig of the built cluster to your filesystem and check if the cluster is healthy.

```shellsession
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get secrets -n claudie -l claudie.io/cluster=hetzner-cluster,claudie.io/output=kubeconfig -ojsonpath='{.items[0].data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d > ~/.kube/hetzner
holu@<your_host>:~# export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/hetzner
holu@<your_host>:~# kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
hetzner-cmpt-qpxeb6w-01   Ready    <none>          7m59s   v1.30.0
hetzner-cmpt-qpxeb6w-02   Ready    <none>          7m59s   v1.30.0
hetzner-cmpt-qpxeb6w-03   Ready    <none>          7m59s   v1.30.0
hetzner-ctrl-78u39wr-01   Ready    control-plane   9m10s   v1.30.0
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we walked through the process of deploying a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud using Claudie. We began by setting up Claudie in a local *kind* cluster, created a Hetzner API key for authentication, and defined a Claudie manifest 
file. After applying the manifest, we successfully created a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud.
