## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy WireGuard UI on a Linux machine using docker compose.

Wireguard UI is a "A web user interface to manage your WireGuard setup".

**Prerequisites**

- Linux Cloud Server (preferably Ubuntu 22.04)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
- Public IPv4 Address

To ensure Docker Compose is correctly installed use:

```bash
docker compose version
```

## Step 1 - Update your server

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo upgrade
```
## Step 2 - Setting up the .YML

The .yml file contains all information needed, 
to create Wireguard-UIs Docker Containers.



```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/wg-ui
sudo nano /opt/wg-ui/docker-compose.yml
```
Paste the following configuration:

```YAML
services:
  wireguard:
    image: linuxserver/wireguard:v1.0.20210914-ls7
    container_name: wireguard
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      # port for wireguard-ui. this must be set here as the `wireguard-ui` container joins the network of this container and hasn't its own network over which it could publis>
      - "80:5000"
      # port of the wireguard server
      - "51820:51820/udp"
    restart: unless-stopped

  wireguard-ui:
    image: ngoduykhanh/wireguard-ui:latest
    container_name: wireguard-ui
    depends_on:
      - wireguard
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    # use the network of the 'wireguard' service. this enables to show active clients in the status page
    network_mode: service:wireguard
    environment:
      - SENDGRID_API_KEY
      - EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
      - EMAIL_FROM_NAME
      - SESSION_SECRET
      - WGUI_USERNAME=admin
      - WGUI_PASSWORD=admin
      - WG_CONF_TEMPLATE
      - WGUI_MANAGE_START=true
      - WGUI_MANAGE_RESTART=true
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: 50m
    volumes:
      - ./db:/app/db
      - ./config:/etc/wireguard
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Step 3 - Starting the Container

To start the container enter:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f /opt/wg-ui/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The output should look like:

```bash
[+] Running 3/3
 ✔ Network wg-ui_default   Created                                                                                                                                        0.1s
 ✔ Container wireguard     Started                                                                                                                                        0.2s
 ✔ Container wireguard-ui  Started
```

Using your browser enter http://<203.0.113.1>

If you were successful you should see the wireguard UI login page. The default credentials are:
 
- U: admin
- PW: admin

Change this password immediately after login in the first time!

**Example terminology**

Many tutorials will need to include example usernames, hostnames, domains, and IPs. To simplify this, all tutorials should use the same default examples, as outlined below.

- Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
- Hostname: `<your_host>`
- Domain: `<example.com>`
- Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
  - Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
  - Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
  - Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
  - Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

Do **not** use actual IPs in your tutorial.

## Step 1 - Summary of Step

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.

Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial.

It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.

Feel free to include screenshots, to show exactly what the user should be seeing. Please put screenshots in a separate "images" folder.

The amount of steps will depend entirely on how long/complicated the tutorial is.

## Step 2 - Summary of Step

Quick introduction.

Start by...

Then...

Finally...

### Step 2.1 - Summary of Step

You can create code examples in nearly every programming language.
Just state the language after the first three backticks in your Markdown file.

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - Summary of Step

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - Summary of Step (Optional)

Instructions for a step that is not necessary to complete the tutorial, but can be helpful.

## Step N - Summary of Step

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
