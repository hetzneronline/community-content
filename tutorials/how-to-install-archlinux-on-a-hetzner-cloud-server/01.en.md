## Introduction

In this article we will install a barebones Arch Linux system on a server that is currently running an OS from RAM or a live ISO.
As long as the target disks are not in use, any linux distribution will work.
For this tutorial I will be using a Hetzner Cloud server booted into the Rescue System.

**Important information**

This tutorial will need you to execute commands in different [chroots](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chroot). This allows us to pivot our apparent root directory to a new location and execute commands as if we have booted the system.

I will inform you whenever we switch into a new `root`.
I will also use the prompt text to indicate which chroot we are currently in.

- `root@rescue ~ # <cmd>` will indicate a command running without chroot
- `[root@bootstrap /]# <cmd>` will be inside the bootstrap environment
- `[root@chroot /]# <cmd>` is inside the Arch Linux installation on the disk

## Step 1 - Setting up the bootstrap environment

We will start by getting the current bootstrap image from a trusted Arch Linux mirror.
This will provide us with the necessary tools for an arch installation.
While we are at it, we will also get the corresponding signature and verify the image before continuing our installation.

```shell
root@rescue ~ # curl -LO 'https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/iso/latest/archlinux-bootstrap-x86_64.tar.zst'
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  164M  100  164M    0     0   115M      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--  115M
```

```shell
root@rescue ~ # curl -LO 'https://archlinux.org/iso/latest/archlinux-bootstrap-x86_64.tar.zst.sig'
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   331  100   331    0     0   4728      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4728
```

```shell
root@rescue ~ # gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-bootstrap-x86_64.tar.zst.sig
gpg: Signature made Sun 01 Sep 2024 02:43:27 PM CEST
gpg:                using EDDSA key 3E80CA1A8B89F69CBA57D98A76A5EF9054449A5C

gpg: Good signature from "Pierre Schmitz <pierre@archlinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 3E80 CA1A 8B89 F69C BA57  D98A 76A5 EF90 5444 9A5C
```

When no error occurs, we can move on to unpacking the image.

```shell
root@rescue ~ # tar xf archlinux-bootstrap-x86_64.tar.zst
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword 'LIBARCHIVE.xattr.security.capability'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword 'LIBARCHIVE.xattr.security.capability'
```

After extraction we need to bind mount the directory over itself. We do this to prevent `pacstrap` from thinking that there is no space left on this device.

```shell
root@rescue ~ # mount --bind root.x86_64 root.x86_64
```

## Step 2 - Setting up boot disk and bootstrapping Arch Linux

From here on we need to work from within the bootstrap environment we just set up. We do this by using `arch-chroot`

```shell
root@rescue ~ # ./root.x86_64/usr/bin/arch-chroot root.x86_64
```

Firstly we need to partition our disk. I am going to use `gdisk` here, but you can also use any other GPT capable partitioning tool.
However `gdisk` is not installed in the boostrap image.
To do this we need to first configure a mirror and setup the pacman keyring and then install `gdisk`:

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# echo 'Server = https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/$repo/os/$arch' > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# pacman-key --init
gpg: /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: starting migration from earlier GnuPG versions
gpg: porting secret keys from '/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/secring.gpg' to gpg-agent
gpg: migration succeeded
==> Generating pacman master key. This may take some time.
gpg: Generating pacman keyring master key...
gpg: directory '/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created
gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/AFB2F3A83C28CC51C20E0752282AC1A0C5C2A266.rev'
gpg: Done
==> Updating trust database...
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
```
```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# pacman-key --populate archlinux
==> Appending keys from archlinux.gpg...
==> Locally signing trusted keys in keyring...
  -> Locally signed 5 keys.

gpg: Note: third-party key signatures using the SHA1 algorithm are rejected
gpg: (use option "--allow-weak-key-signatures" to override)
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   5  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: depth: 1  valid:   5  signed: 101  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 5m, 0f, 0u
gpg: depth: 2  valid:  77  signed:  22  trust: 77-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2024-11-09
```
```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# pacman --noconfirm -Sy gdisk
```

Now we can continue partitioning our disk. Hetzner Cloud servers only ship with one disk attached and this disk is called `/dev/sda`. Your disk naming might differ, so make sure to adjust the command accordingly. Please note that this will delete all partitions and therefore render the data on there useless.

Our partitioning here is very simple. At minimum we need a boot partition (with 1MB size) and a root partition (the rest of the drive in our case).

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# gdisk /dev/sda
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.10

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

Command (? for help): o
This option deletes all partitions and creates a new protective MBR.
Proceed? (Y/N): y

Command (? for help): n
Partition number (1-128, default 1):
First sector (34-40001502, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (2048-40001502, default = 39999487) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: +1M
Current type is 8300 (Linux filesystem)
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): ef02
Changed type of partition to 'BIOS boot partition'

Command (? for help): n
Partition number (2-128, default 2):
First sector (34-40001502, default = 4096) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (4096-40001502, default = 39999487) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Current type is 8300 (Linux filesystem)
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300):
Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'

Command (? for help): w

Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
PARTITIONS!!

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sda.
The operation has completed successfully.
```

We then format our root partition with the ext4 filesystem:

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
mke2fs 1.47.1 (20-May-2024)
/dev/sda2 contains a vfat file system
Proceed anyway? (y,N) y
Discarding device blocks: done
Creating filesystem with 4999424 4k blocks and 1250928 inodes
Filesystem UUID: c14d23b8-5754-49bc-bc27-d1cb48bd76e3

        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
        4096000

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```

We then mount it to `/mnt` and generate our fstab from that:

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
[root@bootstrap /]# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Now we can install Arch Linux via pacstrap. We will use this opportunity to install OpenSSH, as we will need it to connect to our server later.
This may take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection and disks.

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# pacstrap -G -M /mnt base grub linux linux-firmware openssh
==> Creating install root at /mnt
==> Installing packages to /mnt

```

## Step 3 - Finalizing the Arch Linux installation

We can now `exit` out of the bootstrap environment and change root into the installed system to finish setting up:

```shell
[root@bootstrap /]# exit
root@rescue ~ # ./root.x86_64/usr/bin/arch-chroot root.x86_64/mnt
```

We will again start by configuring a mirror and initializing the pacman keyring:

```shell
[root@chroot /]# echo 'Server = https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/$repo/os/$arch' > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
[root@chroot /]# pacman-key --init
[root@chroot /]# pacman-key --populate archlinux
```

Now it's time to install the bootloaded to our drive

```shell
[root@chroot /]# grub-install /dev/sda
Installing for i386-pc platform.
Installation finished. No error reported.
```
```shell
[root@chroot /]# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-linux
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-linux.img
Found fallback initrd image(s) in /boot:  initramfs-linux-fallback.img
Warning: os-prober will not be executed to detect other bootable partitions.
Systems on them will not be added to the GRUB boot configuration.
Check GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER documentation entry.
Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings ...
done
```

Networking will be managed by systemd-networkd. To enable we need to create the file `/etc/systemd/network/ether.network` with the following content:

```file
cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/network/ether.network
[Match]
Type=ether

[Network]
DHCP=yes
EOF
```

This will configure all ethernet network interfaces for DHCP.

Now we activate the required services:

```shell
[root@chroot /]# systemctl enable systemd-networkd
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service'.
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/systemd-networkd.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service'.
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/systemd-networkd.socket' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.socket'.
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/systemd-network-generator.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-network-generator.service'.
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service'.

[root@chroot /]# systemctl enable systemd-resolved
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.resolve1.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-resolved.service'.
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/systemd-resolved.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-resolved.service'.
```

Lastly we would like to have access via SSH to our system.
For this simply create an authorized keys file at `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and write your public SSH key to it. Don't forget to enable the `sshd` otherwise the SSH server will not start after rebooting.

```shell
[root@chroot /]# mkdir /root/.ssh
[root@chroot /]# echo "<your-ssh-pub-key>" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
[root@chroot /]# systemctl enable sshd
Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sshd.service' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service'.
```

We can now exit out from the chroot and reboot our system.
After a few seconds you server should boot into your freshly installed Arch Linux and be reachable via SSH on port 22 using your public key.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a minimal Arch Linux installation on your server. From here on you can start installing additional services like Docker, nginx, K8S, etc.
