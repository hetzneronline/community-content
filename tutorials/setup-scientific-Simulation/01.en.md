## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install and analyze the AstroGen2 simulation on a Linux server to study star formation in galaxies and galactic interactions.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure that your server meets the following requirements.

**For installation and simulation**:

- **Operating system**: Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
- **Already installed**:

  Before starting, install the following software on your system:

  - CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
  - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install cmake gcc g++
  ```

<br>

**For analyzing the simulation results**:

- **Operating system**: Windows

## Step 1 – Installation

Connect to your Linux server and clone the repository onto your machine:

```sh
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Philip-Spaeth/AstroGen2.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd ~/AstroGen2/simulation
```

Build the project using CMake:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Step 2 – Setting up initial galaxy data

The initial conditions for the galaxies must be stored in the `~/AstroGen2/input_data/` directory.

Navigate to the input folder `~/AstroGen2/input_data/` and clone the repository `Example_ICs_AG2`:

```sh
cd ~/AstroGen2/input_data/
git clone https://github.com/Philip-Spaeth/Example_ICs_AG2.git
```

## Step 3 – Simulation configuration

Edit the configuration settings to define galaxy parameters and simulation settings:

```sh
nano ~/AstroGen2/simulation/Config.ini
```

Adjust the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `inputPath`          | Adjust this parameter to select the input dataset. The base directory is `~/AstroGen2/input_data/`.<br><br>Example:<br><kbd>inputPath = Example_ICs_AG2/galIC/22k.dat</kbd> |
| `inputDataFormat`    | If the format of the input file is changed, update this parameter accordingly:<br><br><table border="1" style="border-right: 2px solid black;"><tr><td>.dat</td><td>.gal</td><td>.ag</td><td>.agc</td><td>.age</td></tr><tr><td>gadget</td><td>makeGal</td><td>ag</td><td>agc</td><td>age</td></tr></table> |
| `numberOfParticles`  | Set the number of particles for the simulation here. This value must not exceed the number of particles in the input file. With the above example input file, the maximum would be 22000. |
| `numParticlesOutput` | This additionally specifies how many particles are saved after the simulation. |

## Step 4 – Running the compiled program

After building the project, you can run the simulation:
```sh
cd ~/AstroGen2/simulation/build/
./Astro_Genesis
./AstroGen2
```

## Step 5 – Analyzing the simulation results

Now switch to your Windows device to perform the analysis there.

### Step 5.1 – Setting up AGRender for analysis

* Clone the `AGRender` [repository](https://github.com/Philip-Spaeth/AGRender)

  The `AGRender` program requires a separate directory called `output_data` to store render data.
  ```sh
  <parent-directory>/
  ├── output_data
  └── AGRender
  ```

  If you are using a WSL subsystem under Windows, you can clone the `AGRender` repository directly into the `~/AstroGen2` directory:

  ```sh
  cd ~/AstroGen2/
  git clone https://github.com/Philip-Spaeth/AGRender.git
  ```

<br>


* The calculated data must be located relative to `type.exe` in the `output_data/` folder. For example:
    ```
    <parent-directory>/
    ├── output_data
    |    └── calculatetData1
    |    └── calculatetData2
    └── AGRender
        └── pre_build
            └── type.exe
    ```
  * If you are working with a WSL subsystem, you can directly use the calculated data in the `/output_data` folder:
    ```
    <parent-directory>/
    ├── output_data
    └── AGRender
        └── pre_build
            └── type.exe
    ```
  * If you are working on two separate systems, you need to copy the data from the server into the `/output_data` folder on your Windows computer.
    
    Go to the `AstroGen2` path on your Windows computer and use the following command to copy the calculated data from the server to your Windows computer:
      ```
      scp -r <user>@<windows_ip>:~/AstroGen2/output_data AstroGen2/
      ```

<br>

* Use precompiled binaries or compile from source

  Choose one of the two options.

  * Using precompiled binaries <sup><small><kbd>recommended</kbd></small></sup>
    ```sh
    cd AGRender/pre_build
    ./galaxyPart.exe  or  ./type.exe
    ```

  <br>

  * Compiling the project with CMake

    ```sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

This should start an interactive environment where you can provide additional information.

| Option              | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Data folder to load | Choose the `outputfolder`           |
| video or liveViewer | Select option 2 for a live view of the simulation |

### Step 5.2 – Controls for AGRender

- **Mouse**: Rotate the view

- **Keyboard**: Move and interact with particles

  | Key         | Action                          |
  | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
  | w           | Move forward                    |
  | s           | Move backward                   |
  | d           | Move right                      |
  | a           | Move left                       |
  | L           | Focus on galaxy center          |
  | Ctrl        | Faster movement                 |
  | Space bar   | Start/Stop the simulation       |
  | Left arrow  | Decrease speed                  |
  | Right arrow | Increase speed                  |
  | Keys 1–9    | Display specific particle types (gas, dark matter, etc.) |
