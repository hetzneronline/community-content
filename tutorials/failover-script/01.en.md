## Introduction

With this script it is possible to move the failover IP.

## Usage

Show the current status:

```
./script database get
```

Route the failover IP to 10.0.1.1:

```
./script database set 10.0.1.1
```

## Database server example

`/etc/failover/resources/database`

```
resource database
ip 10.0.0.1
failover_ip 10.0.1.1 10.0.1.2
user <user>
password <password>
script /etc/failover/script/startmysql
```

## The script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# fail.sh v0.2
#

para=$1
parb=$2
parc=$3
pard=$4

# is curl installed?
curl=`whereis curl|awk '{ print $2 }'`
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then echo "Curl is not properly configured" ; exit 1 ; fi

# Where is the robot at?
uri="https://robot-ws.your-server.de/failover.yaml"

# check if first argument is an ip
