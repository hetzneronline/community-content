## Introduction

Geekbench 6 is a powerful benchmarking tool used to measure and compare system performance across various devices and platforms. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of downloading and installing Geekbench 6 on Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution, directly from the terminal.

**Prerequisites**

* Hetzner Cloud server with Ubuntu already installed

## Step 1: Download Geekbench.

[Connect to the server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/connecting-to-the-server) via SSH. If you can't do it via the CLI, you can just use Putty software.

To begin, consider setting the working directory to your Downloads folder. This ensures that any newly downloaded files will be placed in a suitable location.

```console
cd ~/Downloads
```

Next, utilize wget to fetch the benchmark. Substituting "6.2.2" with the most recent version of Geekbench. At the time of composing this article, 6.2.2 stands as the latest version available.

```console
wget https://cdn.geekbench.com/Geekbench-6.2.2-Linux.tar.gz
```

After the download is complete, proceed to unpack it.

```console
tar xf Geekbench-6.2.2-Linux.tar.gz
```

Please proceed to navigate to the directory.

```console
cd Geekbench-6.2.2-Linux
```

## Step 2: Running the benchmark.
You're prepared to initiate the benchmark. Prior to starting, consider closing any resource-intensive applications on your computer for more precise outcomes. Then, proceed to run the benchmark.

```console
./geekbench6
```

The process will require some time, given that Geekbench 6 has an extended runtime compared to earlier versions.

Instead of displaying results on the console, you'll receive a URL.

```console
Upload succeeded. Visit the following link and view your results online:

  https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/424242
```

If you're operating within a graphical desktop environment, you can likely open the link by Ctrl + clicking on it. Alternatively, if this option isn't available, you can manually copy and paste the link into your browser. Another approach is to jot down the link and access it from another device if necessary.

## Step 3: Perform cleanup.

Once you've completed running the benchmark, it's advisable to remove the downloaded files to avoid cluttering your Downloads folder. You can achieve this by returning to your original directory:

```console
cd ..
```

Next, delete the downloaded archive and the extracted folder.

```console
rm Geekbench-6.2.2-Linux.tar.gz

rm -r Geekbench-6.2.2-Linux

```

## Conclusion

Lastly, congratulations on successfully downloading and installing Geekbench on Ubuntu. You've learned how to execute the benchmark and, when finished, remove it from your system.
