## Introduction

An additional feature during creation of a Hetzner cloud server (CX11 and above) is _user data_. This allows the execution of a _cloud-init_ configuration for the newly created server.

After following this tutorial, you will be able to adjust the setup of new cloud servers with custom configuration.

Parts of this configuration are based on [Securing the SSH service](/tutorials/securing-ssh).

## Step 1 - Insert first line

The _cloud-init_ config uses YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") as markup language.

The file should start with a comment on the first line so that the code is interpreted as _cloud-config_ by the server:

```yaml
#cloud-config
```

## Step 2 - Create user

After the initial comment, let us start by creating a new admin user with `sudo` privileges and pre-configured SSH key.\
[How to create a SSH key pair?](/tutorials/securing-ssh#step-3---certificate-based-authentication)

```yaml
users:
  - name: holu
    groups: users, admin
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    shell: /bin/bash
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - <public_ssh_key>
```

## Step 3 - Update packages

The first thing we do is an update of the package lists and installed packages. A fresh copy of Linux may have outdated packages with critical security vulnerabilities.

In this step, you could install necessary packages for your projects too.

If packages are to be installed or upgraded, _cloud-init_ will `update` the package lists beforehand.

```yaml
packages:
  - fail2ban
  - ufw
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
```

## Step 4 – Run commands

_cloud-init_ allows us to run CLI (Command Line Interface) commands right after the server has been created.

Start the procedure by typing `runcmd:` on a new line.

### Step 4.1 – Configure fail2ban

Each command is written to a new line, preceded by a hyphen.

To secure the SSH network protocol a bit, we use _fail2ban_ against brute force attacks. By default, it will ban attackers for 10 minutes – after 5 failed login attempts within 10 minutes.

[More about this step.](/tutorials/securing-ssh#step-2---setup-of-fail2ban)

```yaml
  - printf "[sshd]\nenabled = true\nbanaction = iptables-multiport" > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  - systemctl enable fail2ban
```

### Step 4.2 – Enable ufw

_Uncomplicated Firewall_ (ufw) is used to lock down the system and allow only used services.

Later you will need to allow services or ports (like 80/443) for any applications that require them.

```yaml
  - ufw allow OpenSSH
  - ufw enable
```

### Step 4.3 – Harden SSH

The last sequence of commands is dedicated to securing SSH.

We use the command `sed` to customize parts of the _sshd_config_ file.

Changes made:

- [Deactivate the root login](/tutorials/securing-ssh#step-11---deactivate-the-root-login)
- [Enable user for SSH](/tutorials/securing-ssh#step-13---enable-user-for-ssh)
- [Automatic disconnection in case of incorrect login](/securing-ssh#step-15---automatic-disconnection-in-case-of-incorrect-login)
- [Deactivate unused functions](/tutorials/securing-ssh#step-16---deactivate-unused-functions)

```yaml
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)PermitRootLogin/s/^.*$/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)PasswordAuthentication/s/^.*$/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)X11Forwarding/s/^.*$/X11Forwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)MaxAuthTries/s/^.*$/MaxAuthTries 2/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)AllowTcpForwarding/s/^.*$/AllowTcpForwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)AllowAgentForwarding/s/^.*$/AllowAgentForwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^\(#\|\)AuthorizedKeysFile/s/^.*$/AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i '$a AllowUsers holu' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Step 4.4 - Reboot

We have to execute one last command: `reboot`

Why? Three birds with one stone:

1. After package updates, there might be a reboot necessary for patches to work properly.
2. _fail2ban_ needs a restart to perform the enabled SSH protection.
3. The changed configuration of SSH will be applied after a restart too.

## Step 5 – Create the server

Now boot your secured-by-default cloud server.

After the server is created, go to _Graphs_ using the _Cloud Console_ and wait until CPU usage shrinks to zero. All commands have been executed and the server has rebooted. You can now login over SSH with the created user account.

## Conclusion

Many words for 21 lines of code, huh?

I hope you learned a lot! For example:

- Build a _cloud-init_ config from scratch.
- Create users with sudo and other properties.
- Run commands during first server boot.
- Utilize `sed` to edit parts of a file.

Now go ahead and build something awesome!

**The complete configuration:**

```yaml
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: holu
    groups: users, admin
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    shell: /bin/bash
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - <public_ssh_key>
packages:
  - fail2ban
  - ufw
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
runcmd:
  - printf "[sshd]\nenabled = true\nbanaction = iptables-multiport" > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  - systemctl enable fail2ban
  - ufw allow OpenSSH
  - ufw enable
  - sed -i -e '/^PermitRootLogin/s/^.*$/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^PasswordAuthentication/s/^.*$/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^X11Forwarding/s/^.*$/X11Forwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^#MaxAuthTries/s/^.*$/MaxAuthTries 2/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^#AllowTcpForwarding/s/^.*$/AllowTcpForwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^#AllowAgentForwarding/s/^.*$/AllowAgentForwarding no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i -e '/^#AuthorizedKeysFile/s/^.*$/AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - sed -i '$a AllowUsers holu' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - reboot
```
