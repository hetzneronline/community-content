## Introduction

The LEMP stack (Linux, NGINX, MySQL, and PHP) is a popular alternative to the LAMP stack that uses NGINX instead of Apache. This guide will guide you through basic installation, setup and configuration of a LEMP stack on CentOS 7.

**Prerequisites**

To install LEMP stack in your server, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

## Step 1 - Install Nginx

Nginx is not available in the default CentOS 7 repository, so we will use the EPEL repositories. To add the CentOS 7 EPEL repository, use the following command:

`sudo yum install epel-release`

Now that the EPEL repository is enabled, install Nginx with:

`sudo yum install nginx`

Afterwards, your web server is installed.

Once it is installed, enable Nginx start on boot and run it:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

In order to check if Nginx is running, you can visit your IP address via the browser.

Open in a web browser:

`http://server_domain_name_or_IP/`

**How To Find Your Server's Public IP Address**

If you don't know what your server's public IP address is, there are many ways to find out your public IP address.

From the command line, you can use the `iproute2` tools to get your address by typing this:

`ip a s | sed -ne '/127.0.0.1/!{s/^[ \t]*inet[ \t]*\([0-9.]\+\)\/.*$/\1/p}'`

Another method is to use an outside party to tell you how it sees your server:

`curl https://ipecho.net/plain; echo`

or

`curl https://icanhazip.com`

## Step 2 - Install MySQL (MariaDB)

Now that we have the web server (Nginx) up and running, it's time to install MariaDB. MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system.

Install MariaDB with:

`sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb`

After finishing the installation, enable and start the service:

```
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

Now that our MySQL database is running, we want to run a simple security script that will remove some dangerous defaults and lock down access to our database system a little bit. Start the interactive script by running:

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

The prompt asks you for your current MYSQL root password. At this stage you won’t have one yet, so just leave it blank by hitting enter. When you are prompted to set a root password, just type `Y` and follow the instructions to set up your root password and make note of it.

```
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] y
New password: 
Re-enter new password: 
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!
```

For the rest of the questions, you should simply hit the "ENTER" key through each prompt to accept the default values. This will remove some sample users and databases, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes we have made.

## Step 3 - Install PHP

PHP is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development.

CentOS 7 ships with PHP version 5.4 which is EOL-ed for quite some time so we’ll use the Remi repository to install PHP 7.2.

Run the following command to add the Remi repository to your system:

`sudo yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm`

Once it is added, install the `yum-utils` package and enable the `remi-php72` repository:

```
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72
```

Now you can install PHP FPM and several most common PHP modules with:

`sudo yum install php php-mysql php-fpm`

**Configure the PHP Processor**

It is important to configure PHP properly once it is installed.

Open the main php-fpm configuration file:

`sudo vi /etc/php.ini`

Find this line:

`;cgi.fix_pathinfo=1`

And replace with:

`cgi.fix_pathinfo=0`

Save the changes and quit the editor.

Next, open the php-fpm configuration file `www.conf`:

`sudo vi /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf`

Find the line that specifies the `listen` parameter, and change it so it looks like the following:

`listen = /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock`

Next, find the lines that set the `listen.owner` and `listen.group` and uncomment them. They should look like this:

```
listen.owner = nginx
listen.group = nginx
```

Lastly, find the lines that set the `user` and `group` and change their values from "apache" to "nginx":

```
user = nginx
group = nginx
```

After you save and quit the `wwww.conf` file, enable and start the PHP-FPM service with:

```
sudo systemctl enable php-fpm
sudo systemctl start php-fpm
```

## Step 4 - Configure Nginx to Process PHP Pages

Now, we have all of the required components installed.

We must edit the Nginx server block configuration file and add the following lines so Nginx can process PHP files:

`sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`

Currently, with the comments removed, the Nginx default server block looks like this:

```
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }
    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

Edit to:

```
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  server_domain_name_or_IP;
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

**Note:** Replace the value of `server_name` with the appropriate domain name or IP address.

Save and close the file.

Restart Nginx to make the necessary changes:

`sudo systemctl restart nginx`

## Conclusion

If you have followed the above steps successfully, you should now have the LEMP stack installed on your server. You are now able to upload your sites files to the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory. For testing, you can enter `<?php phpinfo();` content to `/usr/share/nginx/html/info.php` and check with `http://your_server_IP_address/info.php` in your web browser.
