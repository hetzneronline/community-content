## Introduction

If you're running a server, you know that keeping track of what's going on is just as important as setting it up in the first place. Imagine someone logs into your server at 2 AM. Was that you or some random stranger who just found a way in? Without proper notifications, you'd probably never know until it's too late.

That's why real-time alerts matter for system admins. The faster you know about important events, the faster you can respond.

Now, you could set up email alerts, but honestly, email is a pain in the neck for this. It's clunky, prone to delays, and setting up a mail server properly is a headache (SPF, DKIM, Postfix configs etc.). No thanks!

**Telegram**, on the other hand, is perfect for this job:

* üí∞ It's free. No limits.
* ‚≠ê Easy to set up, just an app installation and a bot token.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Works everywhere; on your phone, tablet, desktop.
* ‚ö° Reliable: messages show up instantly, unlike email filters that eat alerts.
* üß≠ Portable: if you switch devices, you still get notifications without hassle.
* üîî Zero risk of "oops I forgot to check my email!"

Therefore, `Telegram` is pretty much the ideal tool for sending yourself server alerts. I've been using it on a daily basis for the past couple of years. It just works seamlessly!

**Prerequisites**

Before we dive in, let's make sure you've got the basics covered:

* A VPS running Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, or similar).
* Basic Linux knowledge! You should be comfortable using the terminal, editing config files, and running scripts.
* Essential packages (we'll use these to interact with Telegram's API):
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl jq
    ```
    * `curl`: used for making HTTP requests to Telegram's API.
    * `jq`: useful for parsing JSON output when debugging.

* Telegram app installed on your phone or desktop. It's free on both App Store and Play Store.

## Step 1 ‚Äì Setting Up Your Telegram Bot

This is where we set up the "middleman" that will deliver notifications from your server to your Telegram account.

### Step 1.1 ‚Äì Create a bot and get its token

* Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.
  
  ![search BotFather](images/botfather-01.png)

* Start a chat with it and run:
  ```bash
  /newbot
  ```
  ![create bot](images/botfather-02.png)

* BotFather will ask you for the followings:
  * a name (e.g., `MyServerNotifier`)
  * a username (must end with `_bot`).

Once created, you'll get something like this:

> Use this token to access the HTTP API:  
> `123456789:ABC-YourSuperSecretToken`

![get token](images/botfather-03.png)

Save that token. We'll need it in a bit.

### 1.2 ‚Äì Get your chat ID

Your bot needs to know where to send messages. There are a few ways to get your chat ID using third party bots but I'm going to show you how you could get yours manually. To get your chat ID follow these steps:

1. Start a chat with your new bot and send `"Hello from admin-01"`, for example!
2. Open this URL in your browser (replace `TOKEN` with your actual bot token):
    ```
    https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates
    ```
    For example, it would look like this:
    ```
    https://api.telegram.org/bot123456789:ABC-YourSuperSecretToken/getUpdates
    ```
3. You'll get a JSON response. Look for `"chat":{"id":987654321,...}`. That number is your chat ID.
   
   ![chat ID](images/getting-admin-chat-id.png)

> üí° Tip: If you want multiple admins to receive alerts, repeat the same process for each admin to grab the chat IDs! We'll handle those chat IDs in the script.

## Step 2 ‚Äì Writing the Telegram Notification Script

Now that we've got the bot ready, let's wire up our server to talk to it.

### Step 2.1 ‚Äì Store your bot token and chat IDs üóùÔ∏è

We don't want to hardcode secrets into scripts, so let's keep them in an environment file:

* Create the file
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/telegram
  ```

* Create and open up `telegram.env` file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/telegram/telegram.env
  ```

* Add the followings inside `telegram.env`:
  ```bash
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="123456789:ABC-YourSuperSecretToken"
  TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS="123456789,987654321"
  ```
  > * Do not forget to replace those placeholders with your actuall values.
  > * If you have multiple chat IDs, separate them with commas and no spaces.

* üîí Lock down the file so only the `root` user can read it:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod 600 /etc/telegram/telegram.env
  ```

### Step 2.2 ‚Äì Create the notification script üîî

Let's create a script that accepts a message and sends it to Telegram.

1. Create and open up `telegram-notify` file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/telegram-notify
   ```

2. Paste this script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -euo pipefail
   
   source /etc/telegram/telegram.env
   
   MESSAGE="$1"
   
   for CHAT_ID in $(echo "$TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS" | tr "," "\n"); do
   curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage" \
       -d chat_id="$CHAT_ID" \
       -d text="$MESSAGE" \
       -d parse_mode="Markdown" > /dev/null
   done
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/telegram-notify
   ```

This is what the script does:

|             | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">set -euo pipefail</kbd> | Ensures the script exits if anything goes wrong. |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">source /etc/telegram/telegram.env</kbd> | Loads your bot token and chat IDs. |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">MESSAGE="$1"</kbd> | Grabs the first argument you pass to the script as the notification text. |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">for loop</kbd> | Sends the message to every chat ID listed in your env file. |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">curl</kbd> | Hits Telegram's API /sendMessage endpoint. |
| <kbd style="background-color:#e2e2e2!important;color:#000;border-radius:6px;">/dev/null</kbd> | Keeps things quiet in your terminal (no messy output). |

Now go ahead and test it out:

```bash
sudo telegram-notify "üòé Hello from my server!"
```

You should instantly get a message on `Telegram`. üîî Yaaay!

## Step 3 ‚Äì Put Your Bot to Work ü§ñ

Now that your server can talk to you through Telegram, let's make it say something useful. Don't worry, no complicated scripts here. We'll do everything with just one line in cron.

Open your crontab either as root or with sudo permissions:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then add the following examples:

* **Daily heartbeat** (server is alive ‚úÖ)
  
  Do you want peace of mind that your server is still up? Send yourself a daily `"I'm alive"` message:
  ```bash
  0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/telegram-notify "‚úÖ $(hostname) is alive as of $(date)"
  ```
  This runs every morning at 9 AM ‚è∞. If you don't get the message one day, then you know something's wrong.

<br>

* **Service crash alert** üö®
  
  If your web server (nginx in this example) stops, you'll know within 5 minutes:
  ```bash
  */5 * * * * ! systemctl is-active --quiet nginx && /usr/local/bin/telegram-notify "üö® $(hostname): nginx is NOT running at $(date)"
  ```
  > üåü Change `nginx` to `apache2`, `mysql`, or whatever service you want to keep an eye on.

## Conclusion

üëè Congrats! You now have a working `Telegram bot` that sends you `real-time` server notifications. You'll never be in the dark again when something happens, when something crashes, or when your web server goes down. You've just turned your server into a chatty assistant that tells you when it's healthy or when a service crashes. No extra files, no complicated configs, just drop these `one-liners` into `cron` and watch Telegram light up ‚ú®.

### Next Steps üë£

**Real-World Use Cases** üí™

Here are some cool things you can do with this setup:

* üì≤ Monitor your web servers (nginx, Apache) and get an alert if they stop running.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Check if your website is up or down
* ‚ö° Track resource usage (disk space, CPU spikes) and get notified before things break.
* üîß LAMP/LEMP stack and website monitoring
* üíæ Automated DB backups
* üìà Health checks & uptime reports
* üîê Security alerts
