## Introduction

Pretix is a versatile, open-source ticket sales software designed to help you manage event ticketing with ease and flexibility. Whether you are organizing a small local event or a large-scale international conference, Pretix offers a comprehensive set of features to streamline the entire ticketing process.

**Prerequisites**

* A Hetzner Cloud account
* Basic knowledge of SSH and Docker
* Domain name or subdomain that you can pointed to your server's IP address (A and AAAA Record)
* A SMTP server to send out mails

## Step 1: Create a Hetzner Cloud Server
**1.1 Create a Project**
1. Log in to your Hetzner Cloud Console.
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.

**1.2 Generate SSH Keys**

Generate SSH keys on your local machine if you don't already have them:
	
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
    
Add the public key to your Hetzner Cloud project:

1. Navigate to Security  in your Hetzner Cloud Project.

2. Click Add SSH Key and paste your public key (usually found in ~/.ssh/your_key.pub).

**1.3 Create basic firewall**

1. Navigate to Firewalls in your Hetzner cloud Project.
2. Click Create Firewall.
3. Add Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS) to Inbound Roules.
4. Give your Firewall a propper Name.
5. Click Create Firewall.

**1.4 Create the Server**

1. Go to the Servers section.
2. Click Create Server.
3. Choose your server location.
4. Select Debian (12) as your image.
5. Select the desired server size (I'll be using CX22 for the purpise of this tutorial)
6. Add your SSH key under SSH Keys.
7. Select the priour created firewall (pretix).
8. Give your server a propper Name 
9. Click Create & Buy Now.

## Step 2: Configure the Server

**2.1 Connect to the Server**

Connect to your server using SSH:
```bash
ssh root@your_server_ip
```
    
**2.2 Update the Server**

Update your server to the latest packages:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**2.3 Set the Timezone**

Setting the correct timezone on your server ensures that your system logs and scheduled tasks are in sync with your local time.

1. List available timezones:

    ```bash
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```

2. Find your desired timezone from the list and set it (replace `Region/City` with your timezone, e.g., `Europe/Berlin`):

    ```bash
    timedatectl set-timezone Region/City
    ```

3. Verify that the timezone has been set correctly:

    ```bash
    timedatectl
    ```

You should see your newly set timezone in the output.

**2.4 Install Docker**

1. Install Docker
	```bash
	apt install docker.io -y
	```
2. Start the Docker service and enable it to start on boot:
	```bash
	systemctl start docker
	systemctl enable docker
	```
3. Verify the installation by checking the Docker version:
	```bash
	docker --version
	```

**2.5 Install PostgreSQL**

1. Install PostgreSQL:
	```bash
	apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y
	```
2. Start the PostgreSQL service and enable it to start on boot:
	```bash
	systemctl start postgresql
	```
	```bash
	systemctl enable postgresql
	```
3. Verify the PostgreSQL Version (note it down for future reference):
	```bash
    psql --version
	```

**2.6 Install Redis**
1. Install Redis:
	```bash
	apt install redis-server -y
	```
2. Open the Redis configuration file for editing:
	```bash
	nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
	```
3. Find the line that starts with supervised and change its value to systemd:
	```bash
	supervised systemd
	```
4. Save and close the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
5. Restart the Redis service to apply the changes:
	```bash
	systemctl restart redis-server
	```
6. Enable Redis to start on boot:
	```bash
	systemctl enable redis-server
	```
7. Verify that Redis is running:
	```bash
	systemctl status redis-server
	```
    
**2.7 Install NGINX**
1. Install Nginx:
	```bash
	apt install nginx -y
	```
2. Verify that Nginx is running: 
	```bash
    systemctl status nginx
    ```

## Step 3:  Add DNS Records (A and AAAA) for Your Domain

To direct traffic to your Pretix installation, you'll need to add DNS records for your domain. This step assumes you have access to your domain registrar's DNS management panel.

1. **Find Your Server's IP Address:**

   To find your server's IP address use the following command:

   ```bash
   ip a
   ```

   Look for the IP address associated with the network interface you are using (usually `eth0` )
2. **Add DNS Records:**

   Once you have your server's IP address, proceed to add DNS records:

   - **A Record (IPv4):** Points your domain to your server's IPv4 address.
     - Record Type: A
     - Host/Name: pretix
     - Value/IP Address: Your server's IPv4 address

   - **AAAA Record (IPv6):** Points your domain to your server's IPv6 address.
     - Record Type: AAAA
     - Host/Name: pretix
     - Value/IP Address: Your server's IPv6 address 

   Save the DNS records after adding them.

3. **Verify DNS Propagation:**

   DNS changes may take some time to propagate worldwide (typically up to 48 hours). You can use online tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to check if your DNS records have propagated:

   ```bash
   dig pretix.example.com A
   dig pretix.example.com AAAA
   ```

   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name. If the IP addresses returned match your server's IP addresses, then DNS propagation is complete.


## Step 4: Installing Pretix
**4.1 Create Data Files Directory**
First, create a directory on your server for Pretix to store its data files. Then, make this directory writable for the user that runs Pretix inside the Docker container:
```bash
mkdir /var/pretix-data
chown -R 15371:15371 /var/pretix-data
```

**4.2 Configure the Database**

You need to create a database and a database user for Pretix. This can be done using any database management tool or directly via the database shell. Ensure UTF8 encoding for compatibility:

1. Check the server encoding:

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SHOW SERVER_ENCODING'
    ```

2. Create a PostgreSQL user and database:

    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres createuser -P pretix
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O pretix pretix
    ```

3. Ensure the database listens on the network. If PostgreSQL is on the same host as Docker but not inside a Docker container, update the `postgresql.conf` file (replace `<version>` with your PostgreSQL version):

    ```bash
    nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf
    ```

    Modify the `listen_addresses` line:

    ```conf
    listen_addresses = 'localhost,172.17.0.1'
    ```

4. Allow network connections by adding a new line to `pg_hba.conf`:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf
    ```

    Add the following line:

    ```conf
    host    pretix          pretix          172.17.0.1/16           md5
    ```

5. Restart PostgreSQL to apply changes:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart postgresql
    ```

**4.3 Configure Redis**

1. Edit the Redis configuration file:

	```bash
	nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
	```

2. Add the following lines to enable Unix sockets:

    ```conf
    unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
    unixsocketperm 777
    ```

3. Save and close the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

4. Restart the Redis service:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart redis-server
    ```

5. To prevent systemd from deleting `/var/run/redis` on every Redis restart, edit the Redis service configuration:

    ```bash
    systemctl edit redis-server
    ```

6. Add the following lines in the editor that opens:

    ```conf
    [Service]
    RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes
    ```

7. Save and close the editor.


**4.4 Configure Pretix**

1. Create a config directory and file for Pretix:

	```bash
    mkdir /etc/pretix
    touch /etc/pretix/pretix.cfg
    chown -R 15371:15371 /etc/pretix/
    chmod 0700 /etc/pretix/pretix.cfg
 	```

2. Edit the configuration file `/etc/pretix/pretix.cfg` and add the following content, adjusting values to match your environment:

    ```ini
    [pretix]
    instance_name=My pretix installation
    url=https://pretix.example.com
    currency=EUR
    ; DO NOT change the following value, it has to be set to the location of the
    ; directory *inside* the docker container
    datadir=/data
    trust_x_forwarded_for=on
    trust_x_forwarded_proto=on

    [database]
    backend=postgresql
    name=pretix
    user=pretix
    ; Replace with the password you chose above
    password=*********
    ; In most docker setups, 172.17.0.1 is the address of the docker host. Adjust
    ; this to wherever your database is running, e.g. the name of a linked container.
    host=172.17.0.1

    [mail]
	from=hello@localhost        ; Email address from which emails will be sent
	host=smtp.example.com       ; SMTP server hostname or IP address
	user=username               ; SMTP username (if authentication is required)
	password=your_password      ; SMTP password (if authentication is required)
	port=587                    ; SMTP port (typically 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
	tls=on                      ; Enable TLS/SSL encryption (use 'on' for TLS, 'off' for SSL)
	ssl=off                     ; Enable SSL (use 'on' for SSL, 'off' for TLS)

    [redis]
    location=unix:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?db=0
    ; Remove the following line if you are unsure about your redis' security
    ; to reduce impact if redis gets compromised.
    sessions=true

    [celery]
    backend=redis+socket:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?virtual_host=1
    broker=redis+socket:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?virtual_host=2
    ```

3. Save and close the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

This configuration file (`pretix.cfg`) sets up Pretix with necessary parameters such as instance name, URL, currency, database connection details, email settings, Redis configuration, and Celery task queue configuration. Adjust values according to your specific setup and requirements.

**4.5 Configure Docker Image and Service**

1. Pull the latest stable Pretix image from Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker pull pretix/standalone:stable
    ```

2. Create a systemd service file for Pretix:

    Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/pretix.service` with the following content:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=pretix
    After=docker.service
    Requires=docker.service

    [Service]
    TimeoutStartSec=0
    ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %n
    ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %n
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name %n -p 127.0.0.1:8345:80 \
        -v /var/pretix-data:/data \
        -v /etc/pretix:/etc/pretix \
        -v /var/run/redis:/var/run/redis \
        --sysctl net.core.somaxconn=4096 \
        pretix/standalone:stable all
    ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop %n

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    - This service file ensures that Docker starts the Pretix container (`pretix/standalone:stable`) with necessary volumes and configurations.
    - Adjust `-p 127.0.0.1:8345:80` to expose Pretix on the desired port (`8345`) on localhost.
    - Replace `/var/pretix-data` with your actual data directory and `/etc/pretix` with your Pretix configuration directory.

3. Reload systemd to apply the new service configuration:

    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

4. Enable the Pretix service to start on boot:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable pretix
    ```

5. Start the Pretix service:

    ```bash
    systemctl start pretix
    ```

6. Verify the status of the Pretix service to ensure it started correctly:

    ```bash
    systemctl status pretix
    ```


**4.6 Configure Cronjob for Pretix**

To automate management tasks in Pretix, set up a cronjob that runs the `runperiodic` management command at a specified interval. Here's how you can configure it:

1. Edit your crontab configuration:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add the following line to run the `runperiodic` command for Pretix:

    ```bash
    15,45 * * * * /usr/bin/docker exec pretix pretix runperiodic
    ```

    - Adjust the timing (`15,45 * * * *`) as per your preferred interval. This example runs the command at 15th and 45th minute of every hour.
    - Ensure the user running the cronjob has permission to use the Docker daemon (`docker exec`).

3. Save and exit the crontab editor.



**4.7 Obtain SSL Certificates with Certbot**

1. Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:

    ```bash
    apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```

2. Run Certbot to obtain SSL certificates for your domain (`pretix.example.com`). Replace `pretix.example.com` with your actual domain:

    ```bash
    certbot certonly --nginx -d pretix.example.com
    ```

    - Certbot will interactively guide you through the process. Choose the option to expand existing coverage if you already have other SSL configurations.
    - Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to serve the challenges needed for validation, obtain the certificate, and update your Nginx configuration.

3. Certbot will place the obtained certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/pretix.example.com/`. Note down the paths to `fullchain.pem` (certificate chain) and `privkey.pem` (private key) for the next step.

**4.8 Configure Nginx Proxy with SSL for Pretix**

After obtaining the SSL certificates using Certbot, proceed with configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy for Pretix:

1. Edit your Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pretix`) and add the following content:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on default_server;
        server_name pretix.example.com;

        location / {
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on default_server;
        server_name pretix.example.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/pretix.example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/pretix.example.com/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8345;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Replace `pretix.example.com` with your actual domain name.
    - Ensure `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` point to the correct paths of `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` obtained from Certbot.

2. Enable the Nginx configuration by creating a symbolic link to `sites-enabled`:

    ```bash
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pretix /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```

3. Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors:

    ```bash
    nginx -t
    ```

4. If the configuration test is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    systemctl reload nginx
    ```

5. Verify that Nginx is running and serving Pretix over HTTPS:

    ```bash
    systemctl status nginx
    ```

**4.9 Access and Start Using Pretix**

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   https://pretix.example.com/control/
   ```

2. Log in with the following credentials:
   - **Username:** admin@localhost
   - **Password:** admin

   **Note:** It is crucial to change the default password immediately after logging in for security reasons.

3. Once logged in, create an organizer profile. This step is necessary before creating events and selling tickets.

4. Create your first event by navigating to the "Events" section and clicking on "Create a new event."

5. Follow the guided steps to set up your event details, ticket types, pricing, and any additional settings.

6. Start selling tickets by enabling the event and sharing the ticket sales page with your audience.


## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Pretix using Docker on your Hetzner server. You can now start managing your event ticket sales with ease. For further customization and configuration, refer to the Pretix documentation.
