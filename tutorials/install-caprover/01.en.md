## Introduction

CapRover is a sleek new way to easily deploy your own apps or an app from their large selection to a Cloud Server. CapRover has a nice web panel to manage your installation, view metrics, and launch new apps. I wouldn't recommend this if you have multiple people who need to connect to one server, due to there being only one login.

**Prerequisites**

- A fresh Hetzner Cloud server running Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04 that you have shell access to
- Any domain

> CapRover's recommended stack is Ubuntu 20.04 and Docker 19.03

## Step 1 - Install Docker

Since CapRover runs on Docker, we'll need to install it.

First - Update your server and install the required packages by running these commands: (Make sure you're logged into the `root` user, as this tutorial assumes you are)

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install curl -y
```

Now we can proceed to installing Docker:

```bash
apt install docker.io
```

This command will install the latest version of Docker. You could now move on to running CapRover.

## Step 2 - Connect your domain

CapRover can run on both a root domain (EX: `*.example.com`) and a subdomain (EX: `*.foo.example.com`).

Go to your domain's DNS management panel and create a new `A` record pointing to your server's IP address:

- **TYPE:** `A` record
- **HOST:** `*` (If you're using a subdomain set this to `*.<subdomain_name>`)
- **POINTS TO:** (IP address of your server)
- **TTL:** (Use the default TTL, or set it to `3600`)

To verify that you correctly configured your domain, visit <https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx>, input `foobar.<your_domain.com>` (`foobar.<subdomain_name>.<your_domain.com>` if you used a subdomain) and check if the domain resolves to the IP address you configured in your DNS settings. **DNS propagation can take a few minutes, so if it doesn't work, just wait some more.** It should take under 30 minutes for DNS to fully propagate.

> **Note:** It is critical that a wild card `*` is assigned to the `HOST` in the `A` record. This allows CapRover to create unique addresses for your application(s) running on the server.

## Step 3 - Run CapRover

CapRover simply runs on top of Docker, making it very modular, and can be installed with one command:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3000:3000 -e ACCEPTED_TERMS=true -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /captain:/captain caprover/caprover
```

Do not change the port mappings, as CapRover will not be able to run on different ports.

## Step 4 - Setup CapRover

Once the previous command has completed, and you waited 60 seconds for CapRover to fully start, you can attempt to login to the dashboard. You can find it at `http://captain.<your_domain.com>:3000/` (`http://captain.<subdomain_name>.<your_domain.com>:3000/` if you used a subdomain). **Note:** you should only use this URL for the initial setup.

The default password is `captain42` - **you should change it later**

When you login you'll be greeted by the dashboard:

![CapRover Initial Dashboard](images/caprover_initial_dashboard.png)

Enter your domain (or subdomain) and press "Update Domain". You'll be redirected to `http://captain.<your_domain.com>` - this is where you can now access your dashboard. Press "Enable HTTPS". Enter your email address in the popup (this is required for the Let's Encrypt certificate). Once it's done you can press "Force HTTPS" to make sure every request is redirected to `https://`

Lastly, **don't forget to set a new password by going to "Settings" and filling out the "Change Password" form!**

## Conclusion

You know have a working CapRover instance ðŸŽ‰! You can use their amazing docs to learn how to deploy existing One-Click Apps, or your own:
