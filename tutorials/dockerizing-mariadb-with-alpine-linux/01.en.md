## Introduction

The official MariaDB Docker image uses [Red Hat Linux][redhat], which is large in size. In this tutorial you will see how to setup your database on [Alpine Linux][alpine].

I use [Alpine Linux][alpine] as the base Docker image for most of my applications. Why? because Alpine is designed with security in mind. The `C` library used is [musl] and the base tools are all in [BusyBox][busybox]. Those are normally found in embedded systems and are smaller than the tools found in GNU/Linux systems.

Another great part of Alpine is their package manager called [Alpine Package Keeper][apk]. For example, you can find and install most of the popular packages with the `apk` command. In this series I want to show you how to install `MariaDB` and import or export your database data with ease.

> This tutorial is split into multiple parts.

## Series index

1. Dockerizing MariaDB with Alpine Linux (You are here)
2. [Import and Export data in Dockerized MariaDB][second_tutorial]
3. [Connect to Dockerized MariaDB with Node.js via Unix socket][third_tutorial]

**Prerequisites**

* Server with Rocky Linux 9

## Step 1 - Install Docker

First of all you have to install Docker on your `VPS`. I purchased a [Rocky Linux 9][rocky] instance on [Hetzner Cloud][hetzner].
If you have another Linux distribution, there are very straightforward steps on the official [Docker website][docker_install], which you can use.

```sh
# Update your instance
dnf -y update

# Install useful packages
dnf -y install \
    epel-release \
    bash-completion

# Reboot your Linux instance
reboot
```
```sh
# Add Docker repo
dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Install Docker
dnf -y install \
    docker-ce \
    docker-ce-cli \
    containerd.io \
    docker-compose-plugin

# Enable and start Docker service
systemctl --now enable docker
```

## Step 2 - Project structure

This is our project directory structure.

> Directories are marked with `/` at the end of them.

```md
maria/
│
├─── Dockerfile
├─── main.sh
│
├─── data/
├─── logs/
├─── socket/
├─── dump/
│    │
│    ├─── import/
│    └─── export/
│
└─── config/
     │
     ├─── my.cnf
     └─── my.cnf.d/
          │
          └─── mariadb-server.cnf
```

```sh
# Create project directory
mkdir /maria

# Change the current working directory to maria/
cd /maria

# Add the directories
mkdir -p data logs socket dump/import dump/export config/my.cnf.d

# Add the files
touch Dockerfile main.sh config/my.cnf config/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf
```

## Step 3 - Build your image

After installing Docker, we have to create our Docker image.
As you may know, Docker images are immutable, which means they can't be modified once created.
For this reason, we should use Docker volumes. With volumes you are able to share files between your main Linux instance (Rocky Linux 9) and a Docker container.

This is our `Dockerfile` config file and instructions about how Docker should build the image.

----------------------------------

**Dockerfile**

```md
# Use Alpine as the base image
FROM alpine:3.20

# Copy the main shell script to image
COPY ["main.sh", "/usr/local/bin/"]

RUN \
    # Add MariaDB packages
    apk add --no-cache \
        mariadb \
        mariadb-client; \
    # Give execute permission to main.sh
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/main.sh

# Specify the start point of our image
ENTRYPOINT ["main.sh"]
```

## Step 4 - Shell script

So far you have done many steps, perfect.

It's time to write the most important part of your project. The `main.sh` is the controller and the start point of the project.

At this stage I show you how the bash script handles our `MariaDB` program.
We need to start and stop `MariaDB` with that bash script.

----------------------------------

**main.sh**

```sh
#!/bin/ash

set -e

signal_terminate_trap() {
    #
    # Shutdown MariaDB with mariadb-admin
    # https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-admin/
    mariadb-admin shutdown &
    #
    # Wait for mariadb-admin until sucessfully done (exit)
    wait $!
    echo "MariaDB shut down successfully"
}

trap "signal_terminate_trap" SIGTERM

# Run
if [ "$REQUEST" == "run" ]; then
    echo "Starting MariaDB ..."
    #
    # Run MariaDB with exec bash command
    exec mariadbd &
    #
    # Wait for MariaDB until stopped by Docker
    wait $!
    exit 1
fi

# Initialize
if [ "$REQUEST" == "initialize" ]; then
    initialize_status="MariaDB is already initialized"

    if [ ! -f "$DIR_DATA/ibdata1" ]; then
        initialize_status="MariaDB initialization done"

        # Initialize MariaDB with mariadb-install-db
        # https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-install-db/
        mariadb-install-db \
            --user=$USER \
            --datadir=$DIR_DATA \
            --auth-root-authentication-method=socket &
        #
        # Wait for mariadb-install-db until sucessfully done (exit)
        wait $!
    fi

    echo $initialize_status
fi
```

- `set -e` command
   - Tell bash to exit the script if any command fails.
- `signal_terminate_trap` function
   - Every bash script will exit eventually, whether our script is completely done or fails. We need to catch that exit and figure out why our script wants to exit.
- `trap` command
   - This command helps us to catch the terminate signal (`SIGTERM`) of our process. In the first param of `trap` we specify the `signal_terminate_trap` function and in the second param we specify the termination signal (`SIGTERM`).
- `if` statement
   - When we start our Docker container, we pass an environment variable to the container and we call it `REQUEST`. I will tell you more about this later.
- `--auth-root-authentication-method`
   - In this tutorial series we will connect to MariaDB via Unix socket. The common way for connecting to a database is TCP connection (`127.0.0.1:3306`). Opening an extra port equals less security. Hackers try to connect to a database via open ports like `3306`. Unix sockets are only available for processes inside our Linux machine.

**SIGTERM important note:**
By default, Docker sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the main process of the container (`main.sh`) when you try to stop your container with the `docker stop container_name` command.

   - [SIGTERM][sig_term] signal
   - [Docker container stop][docker_stop]

-----------

Now it's time to build the image.

```sh
# Build
docker build --rm -t maria:1.0.0 --file Dockerfile ./

# Check Docker images on your Linux machine
docker image list --all
```

- I use `--rm` flag to clean up the temporary container and remove the filesystem after the build is complete.
- Specify the name of your image and its version with `-t`.
- Specify `Dockerfile` with `--file` flag.

## Step 5 - MariaDB config files

Check the `MariaDB` official documents page.

- [Server System Variables][maria_sys_vars]
- [Configuring MariaDB with Option Files][maria_option_files]

----------------------------------

**config/my.cnf**

```md
[mysqld]
symbolic-links=0
!includedir /etc/my.cnf.d
```

----------------------------------

**config/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf**

```md
[client]
socket=/run/maria/maria.sock

[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8mb4

[mysqld]
pid-file=/run/maria/maria.pid
skip-networking

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M
performance_schema=OFF

[mysqld_safe]
log_error=/var/log/maria/error_safe.log

[mariadbd]
user=mysql

datadir=/var/lib/maria/
socket=/run/maria/maria.sock

character_set_server=utf8mb4

log_output=FILE

general_log
general_log_file=/var/log/maria/general.log

slow_query_log
slow_query_log_file=/var/log/maria/slow.log
long_query_time=3

log_error=/var/log/maria/error.log
log_warnings=2
```

## Step 6 - Initialize MariaDB

In this step we want to initialize our MariaDB for the first time. Remember, you should do this step only one time.
After that, `MariaDB` will generate required files in the `/maria/data/` directory inside the `Rocky Linux 9` instance.
These config files are required every time you want to run `MariaDB`.

To prevent permission errors, give the ownership of the `data` and `socket` directories to the `mysql` user.

```sh
# 100:101 -> equals to -> mysql:mysql in MariaDB container
chown -R 100:101 /maria/data/ /maria/socket/ /maria/dump/
```

It's time to initialize MariaDB with the `docker run` command.

```sh
# Initialize
docker run \
    --rm \
    --name maria_initialize \
    --user mysql \
    --env REQUEST=initialize \
    --env USER=mysql \
    --env DIR_DATA="/var/lib/maria" \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf:/etc/my.cnf:ro \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf.d/:/etc/my.cnf.d/:ro \
    -v /maria/data/:/var/lib/maria/ \
    maria:1.0.0
```

- With the `docker run` command you are able to start your `MariaDB` container.
- We are using the Docker volume feature with the `-v` flag. Check the official Docker docs [here][docker_volumes].
- I define multiple environment variables which will pass to the container. One of them is `--env REQUEST=initialize`. Step back and take a look at the [Shell script][step_4] step and you will see we are using the `REQUEST` environment variable in the `if [ "$REQUEST" == "initialize" ]` line of `main.sh`.

Done, and now your Dockerized `MariaDB` is available.

## Step 7 - Running MariaDB

And now, we want to run the `MariaDB` image in `detach` mode.

```sh
docker run \
    --detach \
    --name maria_detach \
    --restart always \
    --user mysql \
    --env REQUEST=run \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf:/etc/my.cnf:ro \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf.d/:/etc/my.cnf.d/:ro \
    -v /maria/data/:/var/lib/maria/ \
    -v /maria/logs/:/var/log/maria/ \
    -v /maria/socket/:/run/maria/ \
    maria:1.0.0
```

If you want to check the status of your container, you should use `docker ps -a` command and you will see something like this in your terminal:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND      CREATED           STATUS          PORTS      NAMES
f0a2ac1365b7   maria:1.0.0    "main.sh"    5 minutes ago     Up 5 seconds               maria_detach
```

In order to stop your container, use the `docker stop maria_detach` command.

----------------------------------

Go ahead and read the [second tutorial][second_tutorial] and see how to import your database data into the `MariaDB` container.

If you don't have any SQL data and want to connect to your `MariaDB` via Unix socket, go to the [third tutorial][third_tutorial] and see how to do it with [Node.js][nodejs].
