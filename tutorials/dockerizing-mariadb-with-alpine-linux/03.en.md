## Introduction

One of the easiest ways to connect and send SQL queries to `MariaDB` is the popular JavaScript runtime called [Node.js][nodejs].

We need the [MySQL][mysql2] library to interact with `MariaDB` and send a simple `SELECT` query.

As I said in the [first tutorial][first_tutorial], the common way for connecting to a database is via a TCP connection (`127.0.0.1:3306`). Opening an extra port equals less security. Hackers try to connect to a database via open ports like `3306`. Unix sockets are only available for processes inside our Linux machine.

Another advantage of Unix socket over TCP connection is the speed.

For more informations, it's better to take a look at [this][ref1] and [this][ref2] link.

> This tutorial is split into multiple parts.

## Series index

1. [Dockerizing MariaDB with Alpine Linux][first_tutorial]
2. [Import and Export data in Dockerized MariaDB][second_tutorial]
3. Connect to Dockerized MariaDB with Node.js via Unix socket (You are here)

**Prerequisites**

* Server with Rocky Linux 9

## Step 1 - Node.js structure

For this tutorial I don't want to Dockerize the `Node.js` app, so I install `Node.js` with the `dnf` command in Rocky Linux. So simple:

```bash
dnf -y install nodejs
```

And now you can check the version of `Node.js` with the `node -v` command.

Every [Node.js][nodejs] project contains atleast one `package.json` file and a JavaScript entry point file, which I named `index.js`.

Put these two files in a new directory, for example:

```
mkdir /nodejs-socket
cd /nodejs-socket
```

----------------------------------

**package.json**

```json
{
    "name": "send_query",
    "type": "module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "dependencies": {
        "mysql2": "^3.11.1"
    }
}
```

----------------------------------

**index.js**

```js
import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';

async function db_connection() {
    const new_connection = await mysql.createConnection({
        user: 'root',
        // This is the MariaDB Unix socket file
        socketPath: '/maria/socket/maria.sock',
        database: 'mysql'
    });

    return new_connection;
}

async function main() {
    const new_connection = await db_connection();
    const db_result = await new_connection.query('SELECT * FROM user;');
    new_connection.end();

    console.log(db_result[0][0].User);
    // mariadb.sys
}

main();
```

Now, you have to install `Node.js` dependencies with the `npm install` command.

After installing dependencies, you will see the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file in your `Nodes.js` directory.

## Step 2 - Running Node.js

It's time to run your code with the `node index.js` command. The `console.log()` statement will print the first user (`mariadb.sys`) of the query in terminal.

----------------------------------

Now, we want to send a query and get all players from the `players` table in the `tennis` database. We created the `tennis` database in the [previous tutorial][second_tutorial]. Now, you have to update the `index.js` file and modify 3 lines:

- Modify `database: 'mysql'` to `database: 'tennis'`
- Modify `SELECT * FROM user;` to `SELECT * FROM players;`
- Modify `console.log(db_result[0][0].User);` to `console.log(db_result[0]);`

Now run this command again:

```bash
node index.js
```

You will see an array like this:

```js
[
    {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Novak Djokovic',
        gender: 'Male'
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Maria Sharapova',
        gender: 'Female'
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Roger Federer',
        gender: 'Male'
    }
]
```

Good job, this is the end point of the [Dockerizing MariaDB with Alpine Linux][first_tutorial] tutorial series.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we send our SQL queries via Unix socket to Dockerized `MariaDB`. This series is a good point for you to work with Docker more and more. Isolating every app via Docker is very good, because Docker containers encapsulate apps and their dependencies, and ensure that they run consistently across different environments.

For example, you can run your Dockerized `MariaDB` on any machine that has Docker already installed on it.
