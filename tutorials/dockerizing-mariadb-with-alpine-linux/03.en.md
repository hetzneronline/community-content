## Introduction

One of easiest ways to connect and send SQL queries to `MariaDB` is the popular JavaScript runtime called [Node.js][nodejs].

We need [MySQL][mysql2] library for interact with `MariaDB` and send a simple `SELECT` query.

As I said in the [first tutorial][first_tutorial], the common way for connecting to a database is TCP connection (`127.0.0.1:3306`). Opening an extra port equals less security. Hackers try to connect to a database via open ports like `3306`. Unix sockets are only available for processes inside our Linux machine.

Another advantage of Unix socket over TCP connection is the speed.

For more informations, it's better to take a look at [this][ref1] and [this][ref2] link.

> This tutorial is split into multiple parts.

3. Connect to Dockerized MariaDB with Node.js via Unix socket (You are here)

## Step 1 - Node.js structure

For this tutorial I don't want to Dockerize the `Node.js` app, so I install the `Node.js` with `dnf` command in `Rocky Linux`. So simple, `dnf -y install nodejs`.

And now you can check the version of `Node.js` with `node -v` command.

Every [Node.js][nodejs] project contains atleast one `package.json` file and a JavaScript entry point file, which I named that `index.js`.

----------------------------------

**package.json**
```json
{
    "name": "send_query",
    "type": "module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "dependencies": {
        "mysql2": "^3.11.1"
    }
}
```

----------------------------------

**index.js**
```js
import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';

async function db_connection() {
    const new_connection = await mysql.createConnection({
        user: 'root',
        // This is the MariaDB Unix socket file
        socketPath: '/maria/socket/maria.sock',
        database: 'mysql'
    });

    return new_connection;
}

async function main() {
    const new_connection = await db_connection();
    const db_result = await new_connection.query('SELECT * FROM user;');
    new_connection.end();

    console.log(db_result[0][0].User);
    // mariadb.sys
}
```

Put these two files in a new directory. Now, you have to install `Node.js` dependencies with `npm install` command.

After installing dependencies, you will see `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file in your `Nodes.js` directory.

## Step 2 - Running Node.js

It's time to run your code with `node index.js` command. `console.log` will print the first user (`mariadb.sys`) of the query in terminal.

----------------------------------

Now, we want to send a query and get all `players` in `hetzner` database. We created `hetzner` database in the [previous tutorial][second_tutorial]. Now, you have to update `index.js` file and modify 3 lines.

- Modify `database: 'mysql'` to `database: 'hetzner'`
- Modify `SELECT * FROM user;` to `SELECT * FROM players;`
- Modify `console.log(db_result[0][0].User);` to `console.log(db_result[0]);`

And you will see an array like this:

```js
[
    {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Novak Djokovic',
        gender: 'Male'
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Maria Sharapova',
        gender: 'Female'
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Roger Federer',
        gender: 'Male'
    }
]
```

Good job, this is the end point of [Dockerizing MariaDB with Alpine Linux][first_tutorial] tutorial series.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we send our SQL queries via Unix socket to Dckerized `MariaDB`. This series is a good point for you to work with Docker more and more. Isolation in Docker for every app is very good, because Docker containers encapsulate apps and their dependencies, and ensuring that they run consistently across different environments.

For example, you can run your Dockerized `MariaDB` on any machine that has Docker already installed on it.
