## Introduction

In the [previous tutorial][first_tutorial] we installed Docker on a [Rocky Linux][rocky] instance and created a fresh `MariaDB` Docker image.

Now, it's time to import and export your data.

> This tutorial is split into multiple parts.

## Series index

1. [Dockerizing MariaDB with Alpine Linux][first_tutorial]
2. Import and Export data in Dockerized MariaDB (You are here)
3. [Connect to Dockerized MariaDB with Node.js via Unix socket][third_tutorial]

**Prerequisites**

* Server with Rocky Linux 9

## Step 1 - Update the bash script

If you haven't read the first tutorial, go to [this][first_tutorial] link and start from there.

In order to import or export data, we have to add more scripts to `main.sh`. You might say: "What if I add a new script file for this purpose?" Adding a new script file would make our project more complex and we don't want that.

It's better to keep the Docker container process in one script and avoid multiple processes.

I added three new sections to `main.sh`. First one is the `dump` function, and other two sections are `Import` and `Export`.

----------------------------------

**main.sh**

```sh
#!/bin/ash

set -e

signal_terminate_trap() {
    mariadb-admin shutdown &
    wait $!
    echo "MariaDB shut down successfully"
}

trap "signal_terminate_trap" SIGTERM

# Run
if [ "$REQUEST" == "run" ]; then
    echo "Starting MariaDB ..."
    exec mariadbd &
    wait $!
    exit 1
fi

# Initialize
if [ "$REQUEST" == "initialize" ]; then
    initialize_status="MariaDB is already initialized"

    if [ ! -f "$DIR_DATA/ibdata1" ]; then
        initialize_status="MariaDB initialization done"

        mariadb-install-db \
            --user=$USER \
            --datadir=$DIR_DATA \
            --auth-root-authentication-method=socket &
        wait $!
    fi

    echo $initialize_status
fi

# dump function will be used for export operation.
#
# This function has two parameters
# First param is "DATABASE_NAME"
# and the second one is "export_path".
#
# As you know, we use these params
# in the function body like this:
# $1 is the first param
# $2 is the second one
#
dump() {
    # Export database data with mariadb-dump
    #
    # Official mariadb-dump docs
    # https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-dump/
    #
    mariadb-dump \
        -u mysql \
        --skip-opt \
        --add-drop-table \
        --create-options \
        --quick \
        --single-transaction \
        --set-charset \
        --skip-comments \
        --add-drop-database \
        --add-drop-trigger \
        --triggers \
        --default-character-set=utf8mb4 \
        --databases $1 \
        --result-file="$2/data_$1.sql" &
    #
    # Wait for mariadb-dump until sucessfully done (exit)
    wait $!
}

# Import
#
# Read the note about .sql files you want to import
# in Step 2.
if [ "$REQUEST" == "import" ]; then
    exec mariadbd &
    #
    # Wait 5 seconds for MariaDB to start
    sleep 5 &
    wait $!

    # Search for .sql files in the import directory
    for i in $DIR_DUMP/import/*.sql; do
        #
        # Use mariadb client to import .sql files
        # into database.
        mariadb < $i &
        wait $!
    done

    mariadb-admin shutdown &
    wait $!
    echo "Import operation successfully done"
    exit 1
fi

# Export
#
# Read the note about export operation
# in Step 3.
if [ "$REQUEST" == "export" ]; then
    exec mariadbd &
    sleep 5 &
    wait $!

    # Use dump function to export our data
    # into the export directory.
    #
    # DATABASE_NAME is one of our environment variables
    # that comes from Docker's --env flag.
    # You will see how to set that in Step 3.
    dump $DATABASE_NAME "$DIR_DUMP/export"

    # Shutdown MariaDB with mariadb-admin
    # https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-admin/
    mariadb-admin shutdown &
    wait $!
    echo "Export operation successfully done"
    exit 1
fi
```

Now it's time to build the new image.

```sh
# Build
docker build --rm -t maria:2.0.0 --file Dockerfile ./

# Check Docker images on your Linux machine
docker image list --all
```

- I use `--rm` flag to clean up the temporary container and remove the filesystem after the build is complete.
- Specify the name of your image and its version with `-t`.
- Specify `Dockerfile` with `--file` flag.

## Step 2 - Import data

How does the import operation work?

First of all, you have to copy your `.sql` files into this `/maria/dump/import/` directory of the Rocky Linux 9 instance.

I give you an example to see how it works.

```md
maria/
│
└─── dump/
     │
     └─── import/
          │
          └─── data_tennis.sql
```

In the `data_tennis.sql`, I assume that you have a database named `tennis` and a table called `players`.

<blockquote>
<details>
<summary>Click here for commands to add a database</summary>

```shellsession
[root@rocky-linux]# docker ps
[root@rocky-linux]# docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh
/ $ mysql -u mysql -p
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE tennis;
MariaDB [(none)]> USE tennis;
MariaDB [(tennis])]> CREATE TABLE players (
    id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
MariaDB [(tennis])]> SHOW TABLES;
```

</details>
</blockquote>

**dump/import/data_tennis.sql**

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS tennis;

CREATE DATABASE
    IF NOT EXISTS tennis
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
    COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

USE tennis;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS players;

CREATE TABLE `players` (
    id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    gender varchar(10) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

INSERT INTO players VALUES (1, 'Novak Djokovic', 'Male');
INSERT INTO players VALUES (2, 'Maria Sharapova', 'Female');
INSERT INTO players VALUES (3, 'Roger Federer', 'Male');
```

Very good, you're ready for the import operation.

----------------------------------

As you can see below, I specify our request environment variable like this `--env REQUEST=import`. Docker will pass this variable into the container's main process (`main.sh`).

- We use the `REQUEST` variable in this line of `main.sh`:
   - `if [ "$REQUEST" == "import" ]; then`

It's time to use `docker run` command.

```sh
# Import
docker run \
    --rm \
    --name maria_import \
    --user mysql \
    --env REQUEST=import \
    --env USER=mysql \
    --env DIR_DATA="/var/lib/maria" \
    --env DIR_DUMP="/var/lib/maria_dump" \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf:/etc/my.cnf:ro \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf.d/:/etc/my.cnf.d/:ro \
    -v /maria/data/:/var/lib/maria/ \
    -v /maria/dump/:/var/lib/maria_dump/ \
    -v /maria/logs/:/var/log/maria/ \
    -v /maria/socket/:/run/maria/ \
    maria:2.0.0
```

You will see the `Import operation successfully done` message in your terminal.

<blockquote>
<details>
<summary>Click here for commands to view the table</summary>

```shellsession
[root@rocky-linux]# docker ps
[root@rocky-linux]# docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh
/ $ mysql -u mysql -p
MariaDB [(none)]> USE tennis;
MariaDB [(tennis])]> SELECT * FROM players;
```

</details>
</blockquote>

## Step 3 - Export data

In this step you have to define your export request environment variable like this `--env REQUEST=export`, and specify the name of the database you want to export like this `--env DATABASE_NAME=tennis`.

- We use the `REQUEST` variable in this line of `main.sh`:
   - `if [ "$REQUEST" == "export" ]; then`

- We use the `DATABASE_NAME` variable in this line of `main.sh`:
   - `dump $DATABASE_NAME "$DIR_DUMP/export"`

```sh
# Export
docker run \
    --rm \
    --name maria_export \
    --user mysql \
    --env REQUEST=export \
    --env USER=mysql \
    --env DIR_DATA="/var/lib/maria" \
    --env DIR_DUMP="/var/lib/maria_dump" \
    --env DATABASE_NAME=tennis \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf:/etc/my.cnf:ro \
    -v /maria/config/my.cnf.d/:/etc/my.cnf.d/:ro \
    -v /maria/data/:/var/lib/maria/ \
    -v /maria/dump/:/var/lib/maria_dump/ \
    -v /maria/socket/:/run/maria/ \
    maria:2.0.0
```

At the end, you will see the `Export operation successfully done` message in your terminal.

Well done, you can see the exported `.sql` file in this `/maria/dump/export/` directory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you were able to import and export your database data with a Dockerized MariaDB.
