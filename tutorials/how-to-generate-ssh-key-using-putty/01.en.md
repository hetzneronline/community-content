## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you on how to create an SSH key using PuTTYgen in your Windows PC and how to copy this key to connect to your server.

**Prerequisites**

* Server running a Linux distribution
* Local PC with Windows

## Step 1 - Install PuTTYgen on Windows

If you don't have PuTTY installed on your PC just download [puttygen.exe](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (select 32 / 64 bits version according your PC, most probably 64-bit).

## Step 2 - Run PuTTYgen

Double-click on the executable just downloaded.

## Step 3 - Generate SSH key

1. Press "Generate" button
2. Move your mouse around on the blank space to randomize your key
3. Change the "Key comment" field to name your key to a meaningful name like: "home", "office", "home-pc-i7", etc.
4. *RECOMMENDED*: Enter a "Key Passphrase" to protect your ssh key. Note: This passphrase will be requested every time you try to connect using the generated SSH key.
5. Save your public/private keys safely on your PC using the buttons "Save public key" / "Save private key".
6. Copy on your clipboard the content of the field "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH `authorized_keys` file.

## Step 4 - Copy public key to your server

### Option 1: Copy key over FTP

* Connect to your server using your preferred FTP Client (eg: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)).
* Edit file `authorized_keys` (location: /home/holu/.ssh/authorized_keys) where "holu" is your username.
* Append the content from your clipboard (done in last substep of Step 3) into the `authorized_keys` file.
* Save.
* Upload `authorized_keys` file.

### Option 2: Copy key over ssh

Open your terminal / [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) client and type:

```bash
ssh-copy-id holu@your_server_ip
```

## Conclusion

You've created a new SSH key and copied it to your server, so you can now use it to easily and securely connect to your server.
