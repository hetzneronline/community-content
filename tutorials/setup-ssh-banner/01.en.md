# How to Set an SSH Login Banner on Hetzner Servers

## Introduction

Displaying an SSH login banner is a simple but powerful way to show any user a message *before* they authenticate. From Cool ASCII based art to legal notices can all be served via the SSH Login Banner. 

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Create a custom SSH login banner
- Enable it on any Linux machine that supports ssh.
- Test the banner message
- Set a Message of the Day (MOTD) for post-login messages

**Prerequisites**

- Any Linux machine with root acccess
- SSH already installed and running

## Step 1: Create the Banner File

Create a new file to hold your banner message:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/issue.net
````

Add your desired message. For example:

```
*********************************************************
  WARNING: Unauthorized access is prohibited!

  This system is monitored. All activity is logged.
  Disconnect immediately if you are not an authorized user.
*********************************************************
```

To make changes to the file, enter: `Ctrl+O` to save and `Ctrl+X` to exit nano.

## Step 2: Configure SSH to Display the Banner

Open the SSH daemon configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find this line:

```bash
#Banner none
```

And change it to:

```bash
Banner /etc/issue.net
```

If `Banner` is commented out (has a `#` in front), remove the `#`.

## Step 3: Restart SSH

To apply the changes, restart the SSH service by:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

If you're connected via SSH, **don't** close your session until you confirm the config works. Restarting `ssh` incorrectly could lock you out.

## Step 4: Test the Banner

From another terminal, SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh user@server
```

You should now see the banner message **before** being prompted for your password or key.

## Setup for a Post-Login Message (MOTD)

If you want to show a message **after** a successful login, edit the MOTD file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/motd
```

Example content:

```text
Welcome to depths that only a few can approach, your Hetzner server!
Remember to update your packages regularly.
```

This message will be shown after login but before the shell prompt.

## Files Modified:

| File                   | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/etc/issue.net`       | Shown **before** login (SSH banner) |
| `/etc/motd`            | Shown **after** login (MOTD)        |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` | SSH daemon configuration            |

## Example Legal Banner (Compliant)

Here is an example of a banner I had spotted in real world usage recently.

```text
NOTICE: This system is for authorized users only.
By accessing this system, you consent to monitoring and logging.
Unauthorized access is prohibited and will be prosecuted.
```

## Congratulations

You’ve successfully set up an SSH login banner on your Hetzner server. This adds a cool look or a legal notice on your server when logging in.
