## Introduction

Hetzner no longer offers a FreeBSD rescue system.
For dedicated servers with full UEFI support there is a tutorial showing how to install FreeBSD with OpenZFS from the Linux rescue system.
https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/freebsd-openzfs-via-linux-rescue

For older servers that only have minimal UEFI support and require legacy BIOS boot there is a different way to install FreeBSD.

**Prerequisites:**

* Hetzner dedicated server booted in Linux [rescue](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/rescue-system) mode with working SSH access
* IPv6 Network configuration parameters:
 * IPv6 assigned address

**Optional:**

* IPv4 Network configuration parameters:
 * IP Address and Network length
 * Default Gateway

*Note: dedicated servers without an IPv4 address must be configured correctly since DHCP and autodetect does not work*

**Example terminology**

* IPv4: 192.168.0.2/27
* IPv4 Gateway: 192.168.0.1
* IPv6: 2a01:4f8:0:0::2/64
* NIC: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver
* Drive 1: `/dev/nvme0n1`
* Drive 2: `/dev/nvme1n1`
 
Use `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` on systems with SATA drives.

We will install FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE in our example.

## Step 1 - Download the FreeBSD distribution archives

Download `base.txz` and `kernel.txz` from a FreeBSD mirror:

```bash
curl -O http://ftp2.de.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/14.0-RELEASE/base.txz
curl -O http://ftp2.de.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/14.0-RELEASE/kernel.txz
```

## Step 2 - Download the mfsBSD installation VM container

We use [mfsBSD](https://mfsbsd.vx.sk/) virtual machine to install FreeBSD on the system drives.

Download the ISO image:
```bash
curl -O https://mfsbsd.vx.sk/files/iso/14/amd64/mfsbsd-14.0-RELEASE-amd64.iso
```

## Step 3 - launch the mfsBSD virtual machine from the ISO image

The server disks are passed through to the VM as SCSI devices using virtio.

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::1022-:22 -m 2048M -enable-kvm \
 -cpu host,+nx -M pc -smp 2 -vga std -k en-us \
 -cdrom ./mfsbsd-14.0-RELEASE-amd64.iso \
 -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi0 \
 -drive file=/dev/nvme0n1,if=none,format=raw,discard=unmap,aio=native,cache=none,id=n0 \
 -device scsi-hd,drive=n0,bus=scsi0.0 \
 -drive file=/dev/nvme1n1,if=none,format=raw,discard=unmap,aio=native,cache=none,id=n1 \
 -device scsi-hd,drive=n1,bus=scsi0.0 \
 -boot once=d -vnc 127.0.0.1:0,password -monitor stdio
```

The SSH service inside the VM is made available on port 1022 of the rescue system

*Note*
The disk devices of the servers will be attached as SCSI disks in the VM no matter what they are on the host.
This means that inside the VM the disks are always mapped to `/dev/da0` and `/dev/da1`.

### Optional set a VNC password to allow VNC access

You need to forward port 5900 using ssh to connect to VNC!

```
(qemu) set_password vnc mfsroot
(qemu) 
```

## Step 4 - copy the distribution files to the VM

On a root shell of the rescue linux system issue the following command:

```bash
scp -o Port=1022 base.txz kernel.txz root@localhost:
```
The root password inside the virtual machine is `mfsroot`.

## Step 5 - Login to the VM

Use ssh to log into the VM from a shell on the rescue system

```bash
ssh -p 1022 root@localhost
```

The password is `mfsroot`

Verify that the drives are visible:

```bash
dmesg | grep QEMU
cd0: <QEMU QEMU DVD-ROM 2.5+> Removable CD-ROM SCSI device
da0: <QEMU QEMU HARDDISK 2.5+> Fixed Direct Access SPC-3 SCSI device
da1: <QEMU QEMU HARDDISK 2.5+> Fixed Direct Access SPC-3 SCSI device
```

## Step 6 - Install FreeBSD

Install FreeBSD with the [zfsinstall](https://github.com/mmatuska/mfsbsd/blob/master/tools/zfsinstall) script

```bash
zfsinstall -d /dev/da0 -d /dev/da1 -r mirror -p zroot -s 16G -u .
```

This will install FreeBSD on a ZFS pool `zroot` using RAID-1 (`mirror`) on both disks with 16GiByte swap space on each disk.

The installed FreeBSD root filesystem will be mounted on /mnt. Since we are running the current version of FreeBSD inside the VM already we can now just use chroot to configure the new installation:

```bash
mount -t devfs devfs /mnt/dev
chroot /mnt
```

## Step 7 - Configure FreeBSD

Once we used chroot to get a shell running inside the installed FreeBSD environment, we can complete the configuration.

Set a root password

```bash
passwd
```

and enable root login with password:

```bash
echo "PermitRootLogin yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "PasswordAuthentication yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

*Note: you may want to disable this later after you created user accounts*

We need to set the hostname, and enable sshd & our newly created autodhcpd script.

Create the file `/etc/rc.conf` with the following content:

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/rc.conf
zfs_enable="YES"
hostname="myhost.mydomain"
sshd_enable="YES"
EOF
```

### configure the network settings

If your server uses a RealTec based network card, the name of your interface is most likely `re0`.
If your server uses an Intel based network card, the name is either `em0` or `igb0`.
If in doubt use Google to find out what your NIC would be called in FreeBSD.

In our example we need to use `em0` as the name of our network card.

Add the following lines to the `/etc/rc.conf` file:

```bash
cat <<EOF >>/etc/rc.conf
ifconfig_em0="192.168.0.2/27"
static_routes="gateway default"
route_gateway="-host 192.168.0.1 -interface em0"
route_default="default 192.168.0.1"
ifconfig_em0_ipv6="inet6 2a01:4f8:0:0::2/64"
ipv6_defaultrouter="fe80::1%em0"
EOF
```


## Clean up

Exit the chroot environment and unmount the filesystems

```bash
exit
sync
umount /mnt/dev
umount /mnt/var
umount /mnt/tmp
umount /mnt
```

You can either shut down the qemu virtual machine or terminate the qemu process.

With everthing set up, you can reboot the server into the FreeBSD distribution:

```bash
reboot
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a working FreeBSD installation that does not require full UEFI support.

-------------

**Additional note:**

If your installation gets broken and doesn't boot anymore, you can use the Linux rescue system to access it:

#### The vKVM way:

Use QEMU to boot your system

1. Boot into the Linux rescue system
2. Boot your FreeBSD system inside a QEMU VM:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::1022-:22 -m 2048M -enable-kvm \
    -cpu host,+nx -M pc -smp 2 -vga std -k en-us \
    -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi0 \
    -drive file=/dev/nvme0n1,if=none,format=raw,discard=unmap,aio=native,cache=none,id=n0 \
    -device scsi-hd,drive=n0,bus=scsi0.0 \
    -drive file=/dev/nvme1n1,if=none,format=raw,discard=unmap,aio=native,cache=none,id=n1 \
    -device scsi-hd,drive=n1,bus=scsi0.0 \
    -boot once=d -vnc 127.0.0.1:0,password -monitor stdio
   ```
3. Use either VNC or ssh to connect to the VM and make your changes
4. Shutdown your VM guest
   ```bash
   poweroff
   ```
5. Reboot the rescue system
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

#### The OpenZFS way:

Use the Linux rescue system to access the file system:

1. Boot into the Linux rescue system
2. Install OpenZFS using `zfs`
   ```bash
   zfs
   ```
3. Import your root pool without mounting its datasets
   ```bash
   zpool import -o cachefile=none -f -N zroot
   ```
4. Mount your root dataset
   ```bash
   mount -t zfs zroot/root /mnt
   ```
5. Make any modifications you need and reboot
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```
