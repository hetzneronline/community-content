## Introduction

In this tutorial I will guide you on setting up Proxmox in a Hetzner Cloud instance. Even if we can´t (till now) use KVM, as nesting is not supported/enabled, we can still benefit using LXC containers.

At the end of this tutorial, we will be able to deploy LXC containers, which can communicate to the outside world, and even have ports redirected to them.

**Prerequisites**

- Hetzner Cloud instance
- All commands provided can be run either via SSH, or by using the WebUI-Shell

## Step 1 - Install Proxmox VE

Before you can get started with this tutorial, send a support request with a link for a direct download of the Proxmox VE ISO to the Hetzner support so that they can add it to your account (see [How can I get a custom ISO?](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/faq#how-can-i-get-a-custom-iso)).

Go to the [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/), select "Support" and choose "Miscellaneous" as your support request type. The request should include:

* The link for a **direct download** of the Proxmox ISO (see [Proxmix Downloads](https://www.proxmox.com/de/downloads)), for example:
  ```text
  https://enterprise.proxmox.com/iso/proxmox-ve_8.2-2.iso
  ```
* The architecture type that this ISO supports, for example `x86`.

After the ISO was added to your account, you can select your server in Cloud Console, navigate to "ISO images" and mount the Proxmox ISO. I will not cover the installation itself, as this is perfectly documented by Proxmox:
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation

The only point to keep in mind is, do you want to use the included Proxmox VE storage replication framework (https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pvesr.html)?

If this is the case, and you don´t want/need an additional Cloud Volume, you have to choose zfs (RAID0) during installation.

`Note: Clustering will be added in the near future`

After the installation completed, don´t forget to unmount the ISO again.

## Step 2 - Repository configuration (optional)

If you have no license and want to leave it that way, you will need to adapt the repository configuration.
For this, we disable the `pve-enterprise` and activate the `pve-no-subscription` repositories.

```bash
sed -i 's/^deb/#deb/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list
```

## Step 3 - Network configuration - prerequisites

In case you want to stick with the default Linux Bridge, there´s nothing to do.
I, however, prefer to use OpenvSwitch.

As a preparation, we make sure we have the most recent package lists available:
```bash
apt update
```

### Step 3.1 - Install ifupdown2

To be able to apply our changes on the network configuration via the WebUI, we have to install the ifupdown2 package:
```bash
apt install ifupdown2 -y
```

### Step 3.2 - Install OpenvSwitch (Optional)

```bash
apt install openvswitch-switch -y
```

### Step 3.3 - Remove default Bridge

As we do, in no way, benefit from the default Bridge, we will remove it.
For this, adapt `/etc/network/interfaces` as below, and save it as `/etc/network/interfaces.new`:

```bash
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto ens3
iface ens3 inet static
        address <your.public.ip.address>/32
        gateway 172.31.1.1
        pointopoint 172.31.1.1
        dns-nameservers 185.12.64.1 185.12.64.2
        post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        post-up iptables -t nat -F
```

Afterwards, we can activate this change without loosing connectivity via the WebUI.
Select your Host on the left side, and in the menu navigate to `System -> Network`, where you can click on `Apply Configuration`

`post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` enables forwarding for packets.
`post-up iptables -t nat -F` flushes all Masquerade/Forwarding rules

## Step 4 - Network configuration

This step depends on wether you want to use the basic Linux Bridge, or an OpenvSwitch-Bridge.
You will have to choose a subnet for your containers, and an IP for your Host as Gateway.
For example:

- Subnet: 172.20.1.0/24
- Gateway: 172.20.1.1

Select your Host on the left side, and in the menu navigate to `System -> Network`.

### Step 4.1.a - Linux Bridge

Click `Create -> Linux Bridge`, choose a name and fill the desired subnet (by using the Gateway-IP) for your containers:
`172.20.1.1/24`
Leave all other fields on their default values.

### Step 4.1.b - OpenvSwitch Bridge

Click `Create -> OVS Bridge` and choose a name (e.g. `vmbr0`) for the bridge.
Next, click `Create -> OVS IntPort`, choose a meaningful name (e.g. `gw_vmbr0`) and select the Bridge we just created.
Additionally, we also fill the desired subnet (by using the Gateway-IP) for your containers:
`172.20.1.1/24`

### Step 4.2 - Masquerade

For our containers to be able to communicate to the outside world, we need to tell our Host to Masquerade them.
To do this, we edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces.new` and search for a line like `iface vmbr0 inet ...`, where vmbr0 is of course our before choosen name.
Either directly below, or after the following indented lines, insert the following (indented):

```bash
        post-up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s '172.20.1.0/24' -o ens3 -j MASQUERADE
```

Of course, you have to replace `172.20.1.0/24` with your desired subnet.

Afterwards, we can activate our changes - select your Host on the left side, and in the menu navigate to `System -> Network`, where you can click on `Apply Configuration`

## Step 5 - Port forwarding (Optional)

In case you want to forward a port from your Host to a container, we edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces` and search for our `masquerade`-line.
After it, again indented, insert the following:

```bash
        post-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ens3 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 172.20.1.1:8080
```

Of course, adapt this line to your needs (udp instead of tcp, target, ...).

Either directly save the file, and paste the inserted line without `post-up`, or save the file as `/etc/network/interfaces.new` and activate it via the WebUI.

## Step 6 - Create container

The process itself is not scope of this tutorial, and any documentation needed should be available here: https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#chapter_pct

Keep in mind, when creating a container, to give it an IP from your chosen subnet, and to specify for chosen Gateway IP (see introduction to Step 4)

## Conclusion

We now have a basic setup, on which we can deploy LXC containers. In the near future, as mentioned in the beginning, I will extend this tutorial.
