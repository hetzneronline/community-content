## Introduction

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication.

It allows communication via online chat, voice over IP, and video telephony.

[Element](https://element.io/) is the reference implementation of a client. Many other clients, bots, bridges, servers and other implementations of the Matrix protocol also exist.

**Prerequisites**

- A cloud server (with ubuntu or debian)
- A domain
  - DNS A Record: `<sub.example.com> IN A  <ipv4.of.your.server>`
  - DNS AAAA Record: `<sub.example.com> IN AAAA <ipv6.of.your.server>`
  - DNS SRV Record: `_matrix._tcp IN SRV 10 0 443 <sub.example.com>.`

You can start with a Hetzner CX11 and rescale later if necessary.

## Step 1 - Setup server

### Step 1.1 Update the system

```console
apt update && apt upgrade
```

### Step 1.2 Install docker and docker-compose with their dependencies

```console
apt install docker-compose
```

## Step 2 - Setup applications

We'll going to run Matrix with it's dependencies via Docker, this includes

- Synapse
- Postgresql
- Traefik

The turnserver (coturn) will be run natively since docker performs very badly while handling large port ranges.

### Step 2.1 - Prerequisites

Create basic folder structure

```console
mkdir -p /srv/docker/matrix-dockerized/

cd /srv/docker/matrix-dockerized/
```

### Step 2.2 - Populate compose file

Create `docker-compose.yml` and fill it with the below contents (make sure to replace at least `sub.example.com` with your created domain records as from the prerequisits).

```console
version: '2.2'
services:

  synapse:
    image: matrixdotorg/synapse:latest
    expose: 
     - 8008
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.synapse.entrypoints=websecure,synapse"
      - "traefik.http.routers.synapse.rule=PathPrefix(`/_matrix{regex:$$|/.*}`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.synapse.tls.certresolver=myresolver"
    volumes:
      - ./data/synapse:/data
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - "postgres"

  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse_user        
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretpassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=synapse
      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS="-E UTF-8"
      - LC_COLLATE=C
      - LC_CTYPE=C
    volumes:
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: always

  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data/traefik/letsencrypt:/letsencrypt
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
    command:
      #- "--log.level=DEBUG"
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--entrypoints.synapse.address=:8448"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=myvalidemailaddress@emailprovider.tld"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"    
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "8448:8448"
      - "8080:8080"

  whoami:
    image: "traefik/whoami"
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`sub.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls.certresolver=myresolver"

```

### Step 2.3 - Configure Synapse

Make sure to replace `sub.example.com` with your chosen domain as part of the prerequisites.

```console
docker run -it --rm -v /srv/docker/matrix-dockerized/data/synapse:/data -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=<sub.example.com> -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=no matrixdotorg/synapse:latest generate
```

- Customize the generated `homeserver.yaml` according to your needs.
- Change at least the database driver and let it point to your postgresql container.

```console
database:
  name: psycopg2
  txn_limit: 10000
  args:
    user: synapse_user
    password: secretpassword
    database: synapse
    host: matrix-dockerized_postgres_1
    port: 5432
    cp_min: 5
    cp_max: 10
```

### Step 2.4 - Setup Coturn

Install and configure coturn on the host.

```console
apt install coturn
```

Uncomment and configure the below settings at `/etc/turnserver.conf`

```console
listening-ip=serverip
listening-ip=serveripv6
use-auth-secret
static-auth-secret=myatleast32characterssecret
realm=sub.example.com
```

Add your turnservice to your synapse config at your `homeserver.yml`

```console
turn_uris: ["turn:sub.example.com:3478?transport=udp"]
turn_shared_secret: "myatleast32characterssecret"
```

## Step 3 - Test and have fun

### Step 3.1 Bootstrap

```console
docker-compose up
```

Follow the provided debug output and make sure that there are no further warnings or issues.

### Step 3.2 Add an (admin) user

You can add users via the included `register_new_matrix_user` script at any time. In case you want to run a public server of course there is the possibility to enable user registration within your `homeserver.yml`.

```console
docker exec -it matrix-dockerized_synapse_1 register_new_matrix_user http://localhost:8008 -c /data/homeserver.yaml --help
```

### Step 3.3 Login and test

The general availability of your new matrix homeserver can be tested via:

`https://sub.example.com/_matrix/static/`

You should see a landing page and follow the link to the clients page in order to choose and install a client.

There are also external tools available for further debugging, for example:

`https://federationtester.matrix.org/`

## Conclusion

This is one of many possible examples on how to setup, run and participate on the matrix network with your own homeserver. It does not cover further requirements which might be of interest for the long run such as:

- backups
- encrypted voip
- self-hosted federation
- ...

The community at `matrix.org` is always a good start in order to extend your knowledge and customize your homeserver according to your needs.
