## Introduction

Many of you have probably used [Iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) before and probably found it quite cumbersome:

* Hard to read rules
* No *really* streamlined way to persist rules across reboots
* Generally a mess to script with, using shell scripts

Well, turns out there is a great successor to Iptables! It's pretty simple to use and surprisingly few people know about it: [nftables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nftables), short "nft" (that abbreviation really hasn't aged well...)!

In this tutorial we'll be setting up a simple firewall allowing all ports outgoing as well as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH and DNS incoming.

**Prerequisites**

* All you need is *any* Linux distro that provides nftables. That is pretty much any Linux distro that has been updated within the last 10 years.

  On Debian and Ubuntu the package is called `nftables`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nftables
  ```

* You should also make sure no frontends like UFW are currently in use. For UFW, run this command to make sure:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw disable
  ```

You can use `nft --version` and `sudo ufw status` to check their status.

**Example terminology**

* Main network interface: `enp5s0`

## Step 1 - Opening the configuration file

Most distros have either `/etc/nftables.conf` or `/etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf`. Whichever one exists on your system, open it in your favorite editor:

```bash
sudo editor /etc/nftables.conf
```

## Step 2 - Deleting the skeleton

The file may either be empty or look something like this:

```nft
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

flush ruleset

table inet filter {
        chain input {
                type filter hook input priority filter;
        }
        chain forward {
                type filter hook forward priority filter;
        }
        chain output {
                type filter hook output priority filter;
        }
}
```

If this is the case, **clear** the file before continuing.

**Otherwise STOP:** You are going to have to make sure to carry over any existing rules. One way could be to not clear the file but to **append** instead (but that could potentially be problematic). Handling this case is out of scope of this tutorial.

**Important note:** Do not delete any important existing rules (for virtualization, for example).

## Step 3 - Writing the firewall configuration

Here's a template. You can go ahead and paste it into the config file:

> Replace the example interface and custom settings as explained in "Step 3.1".

```nft
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# Variables
define main_interface = "enp5s0"

# Delete previous table
table ip my_filter
delete table ip my_filter

# Create new table
table ip my_filter {
    # Filter ingoing traffic
    chain input {
        type filter hook input priority 0;

        iifname $main_interface tcp dport {22, 80, 443} accept
        iifname $main_interface udp dport 53 accept
        iifname $main_interface ip protocol icmp accept # Accept all ICMP traffic
        iifname $main_interface ct state established,related accept # Accept any input traffic originated from us
        iifname $main_interface ct state invalid drop # Drop invalid packets...
        iifname $main_interface icmpv6 type {echo-request,nd-neighbor-solicit} accept # Accept IPv6 neighbour discovery
        iifname $main_interface drop # Drop everything else
    }

    # Drop all packages to be forwarded (we're not a gateway!)
    chain forward {
        type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
    }

    # Allow all outgoing traffic
    chain output {
        type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
    }
}
```

### Step 3.1 - Customize the configuration file

Make sure to change `enp5s0` to your public-facing network interface. If you have multiple, you can specify it like so:

```bash
define main_interface = {"enp5s0", "enp7s0"}
```

Now just add whatever ports you'd like to be reachable to those lines:

```bash
iifname $main_interface tcp dport {22, 80, 443} accept
iifname $main_interface udp dport 53 accept
```

Note that you must only use `{}` when specifying multiple ports. Alternatively, if you don't need any UDP ports accessible you can just omit the whole line.

You can also specify port ranges like this:

```bash
iifname $main_interface udp dport {53, 1000-1999} accept
```

> **Tip:** Chains with lower priority are processed first.

### Step 3.2 - Allow forwarding to bridges (Optional)

In some cases, you'd have bridge networking set up for virtual machines. In this case, you'd have to allow forwarding to those bridges.

To do this, simply add the following rule to the end of the `forward` chain, replacing `br0` with your bridge interface for each:

```bash
iifname $main_interface oifname "br0" accept
```

And remove the comment above the chain.

## Step 4 - (Re)load the firewall rules

Now that we are ready to apply our new rules, just mark the configuration file as executable (only needed once):

```bash
sudo chmod a+x /etc/nftables.conf
```

And simply execute it like:

```bash
sudo /etc/nftables.conf
```

You can repeat this step any time in the future you'd like to change the rules. They are also going to be applied automatically when rebooting.

## Step 5 - Troubleshooting

* **I can't connect anymore!**
  
  That sucks, but it's fixable! If your server is a cloud server, you can log in via the cloud web interface and run `sudo nft delete table ip my_filter` to disable the firewall temporarily.
  
  If your server is a dedicated server, you could either order a KVM (if you don't want to reboot the server) and run the command above, or you could reboot into the rescue system via the Hetzner Robot web interface and manually delete the firewall configuration.
  
  You've probably just forgotten to allow incoming connections on your SSH port!


* **The firewall doesn't work**
  
  If the configuration applies without an error but has no effect, please make sure you've changed `main_interface` to the public-facing network interface:
  
  ```bash
  define main_interface = "enp5s0"
  ```

## Conclusion

Now you have a nice and modern Firewall set up using nftables! There is also a [nftables wiki](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php) available that may be worth a read.
