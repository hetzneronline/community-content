## Introduction

The NiceGUI implements a promising solution for web development in Python language.
[see documentaiton of nicegui](https://nicegui.io/)

NiceGUI makes use of several recent software approaches such as FastAPI, web-sockets which make
its deployment different to the popular synchronous web frameworks such as Flask or Django.

I will use the domain name provided by Hetzner (reverse DNS) in order to diminish the hassle of buying a custom domain name.

This tutorial shows how to deploy a basic NiceGUI application in production on Ubuntu server.
I will use `pyenv` script for installation of Python. Initially, this is more cumbersome than
using `apt`, but it makes your installation more flexible with respect to changing Python versions.

**Prerequisites**

- Basic knowledge of Linux & the terminal
- The virtual private server (VPS) with a dedicated IPv4 address. The cheapest option will do.
- The initial setup of Ubuntu server (version 22.04) [Tutorial initial setup Ubuntu](howto-initial-setup-ubuntu/01.en.md)
- I assume the user account is named `user` and it works from the **bash** shell.


## Step 1 - Install Python

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is an open-source software for managing the Python
interpreters.
See this [blog post](https://medium.com/@aashari/easy-to-follow-guide-of-how-to-install-pyenv-on-ubuntu-a3730af8d7f0) for a more detailed explanation.

### Step 1.1 - Install Pyenv

- Login to the VPS as **root**
- Install the Ubuntu build tools

```commandline
apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

- Login to the VPS as **user**
- Install pyenv via `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
- Adjust the file `.profile` in the home folder by appending the recommended commands.

For example, in my case the `.profile` ends up with

```shell
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

- Logout
- Login as user
- Update pyenv's data via `pyenv update`

### Step 1.2 - Install Python via Pyenv

- Login as user
- Install Python 3.11.9 via `pyenv install 3.11.9`

To verify the installed Python interpreter:

- Create a folder `mkdir tmp`
- Step-in to the new folder `cd tmp`
- Define Python interpreter to be used within current folder `pyenv local 3.11.9`
- Verify the version of the Python interpreter `python --version`

## Step 2 - Create the application

We will create a simple application with NiceGUI and see how it runs in development.

### Step 2.1 - Create the main file

- Login as user
- Create a root directory for the application `mkdir nicegui-test`
- Step in to the `nicegui-test` directory `cd nicegui-test`
- Create a file `nicegui-test/main.py` with the following content

```python
"""."""
from nicegui import ui
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


def main() -> None:
    """."""
    ui.icon('settings')

    with ui.pyplot(figsize=(3, 2)):
        x = np.linspace(0.0, 5.0)
        y = np.cos(2 * np.pi * x) * np.exp(-x)
        plt.plot(x, y, '-')

    ui.notify('my notification')

    with ui.scene(width=320, height=240) as scene:
        scene.spot_light(distance=100, intensity=0.6).move(-10, 0, 10)
        with scene.group() as group:
            scene.sphere().move(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
            scene.sphere().move(+2.0, 0.0, 0.0)
            group.rotate(30.0, 0.0, 0.0)


if __name__ in ('__main__', '__mp_main__'):
    main()
    ui.run(port=5000)
```

### Step 2.2 - Run the application in development mode

Let's run the `main.py` in the development mode to see what it does.

- Login as user
- Step into the `nicegui-test` directory from the previous step.
- Define the Python interpreter to be used via `pyenv local 3.11.9`
- Create a local Python environment `python -m venv env`
- Activate the local Python environment `source env/bin/activate`
- Install the NiceGUI and matplotlib `pip install nicegui matplotlib`
- Run the app `python main.py`

The web app should be served from your VPS.
The address:port combination will be shown in terminal.
You might need to add an inbound rule to your firewall allowing TCP traffic on port 5000.
If this is done or there is no firewall activated in your VPS, then please direct to the
browser to see the screen

![Development deployment in browser](images/dev.png)

Note the `settings` icon, 
the matplotlib figure and 
the interactive 3D scene with two unadorned spheres.
You can interact with the scene (rotate, zoom, pan) with mouse.  

## Step 3 - Create the system service

After playing with the development deployment, 
we will want to deploy the app in production.
The good news is that NiceGUI is using the production-grade web
server `uvicorn` under the hood. Our part of the work is to configure
the `systemd` service `nicegui-test`. 
The service `nicegui-test` will automatically run after restarts.

Moreover, we will split the application and its deployment
by using a little script `asgi.py`.
The purpose of this script is to define the port.

- Login as **user**
- Create the file `nicegui-test/asgi.py` (next to `main.py`). The file `asgi.py` should contain

```python
from main import main
from nicegui import ui

main()
ui.run(port=5129)
```

- Login as **root**
- Create a system service file at `/etc/systemd/system/nicegui-test.service` with the following content

```unit file (systemd)
[Unit]
Description = Running a test of NiceGUI.
After = network.target

[Service]
User = user
Group = www-data
WorkingDirectory = /home/user/nicegui-test
Environment="PATH=/home/user/nicegui-test/env/bin"
ExecStart=/home/user/nicegui-test/env/bin/python asgi.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Start the newly created service `systemctl start nicegui-test`
- Verify the service is running `systemctl status nicegui-test`
  - The address:port combination will be shown in the output of the last command.
  - You might need to add an inbound rule to your firewall allowing TCP traffic on port 5129.
  - Direct to address:5129 in your browser and see the application screen as in case of development deployment.  
- Enable the automatic start of the service `systemctl enable nicegui-test`

## Step 4 - Configuration of nginx

Next challenge is to configure the domain name. We will use `nginx` software.
After this step, the application will be served via a domain name and standard port.

- Loging as **root**
- Install nginx via `apt install nginx`
- Verify the `nginx` is functional: direct to the (IP) address in the browser and see the default page

![Default nginx page](images/default-nginx-page.png)

- Create a new configuration file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/nicegui-test.conf` with the following content:

```nginx configuration
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name <domain-name>.de;

	location / {
		include proxy_params;
                proxy_pass http://localhost:5129;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
	}
}
```

Note: the `<domain-name>` in the configuration file above could be the automatic 
reverse DNS name assigned by Hetzner. This is visible in the _Networking_ tab of
your VPS.

![Networking tab at Hetzner](images/networking-tab-hetzner.png)

If you have the domain name configured at Hetzner, then you might want to 
specify it as `server_name` field.

Note: the `<domain-name>` could be also the IP address. However, in this case
the traffic will be served unencrypted (only http, no https possibility).

- Remove all files from the sites-enabled folder `rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*`
- Create symbolic link in sites-enabled folder
`ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nicegui-test.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled`
- Verify the nginx configuration `nginx -t`
- Restart the `nginx` service via `systemctl restart nginx`
- Verify the NiceGUI application is served at the (IP) address _at standard port 80_
  - Direct to the IP address of the server without specifying any port number.
  - Note that you might need to hard-reload the page with `Ctrl+F5` key combination.


## Step 5 - Obtaining SSL certificate (https)

Finally, lets set up an SSL certificate for our experimental web page.
This is possible to do via "Let's encrypt" project by Linux foundation.

A good video tutorial on the topic is produced at [Tony Teaches Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghZXFyIyK1o)

Below you will find the instructions from this tutorial with some extra explanations
applicable to this production deployment.

In order to serve via HTTPS, we use `certbot`.

- Login to the vps as **root**
- Install `snap` package manager `apt install snap snapd`
- Set up the snap registry via `snap install core; snap refresh`
- Install `certbot` via `snap install --classic certbot`
- Use `certbot` for ordering and setting up the SSL certificate. Start an interactive session with with `certbot --nginx`

The `certbot` will ask an e-mail address and the domain name for which the certificate will be issued.
The `certbot` will ensure the ownership of the domain name and generate the certificate.
As a result of a successful `certbot` run, the following configurations will be done:

- The `nginx` configuration at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/nicegui-test.conf`.
If the configuration was simple as in the section above, then it will be extended with 
redirection instructions and become similar to the following
 
```
server {
        server_name <domain-name>.de;

        location / {
                include proxy_params;
                proxy_pass http://localhost:5129;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain-name>.de/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain-name>.de/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

server {
    if ($host = <domain-name>.de) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


        listen 80;
        server_name <domain-name>.de;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot


}
```

- A periodic service for the automatic certificate renewal will be added. This configuration can be verified by `systemctl list-timers`

The configuration of the timer and service could be viewed in the files
`/etc/systemd/system/snap.certbot.renew.timer` and `/etc/systemd/system/snap.certbot.renew.service`.


## Conclusion

Great, you did it! This was a basic introduction to deploying a test NiceGUI application on
Ubuntu 22.04 by using `pyenv`, `systemd`, `nginx` and `certbot`.
