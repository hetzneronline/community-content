## Introduction

In this tutorial, I show you how to set up a Gitlab CE server on a Hetzner cloud machine using docker and docker-compose. As reverse proxy and to provide a LetsEncrypt certificate we use Traefik. Also, we provide a docker image registry with Gitlab.

**Prerequisites**

- A Hetzner cloud machine (I recommend at least the CX21 instance).
- A domain under which we later reach our Gitlab server and the docker image registry.
- Ubuntu 18.04 as the operating system.

## Step 1 - Preparing the cloud machine, install docker and docker-compose

To provide sufficient resources for the Gitlab server, we recommend at least the CX21. A later change to a more powerful instance is no problem. As the operating system we use Ubuntu in our case 18.04. After you have provided the instance, you connect to the machine as root.

Before we start, we update the system:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

Now we install docker and docker-compose first. For docker, there is a handy install script at get.docker.com.

First, we download the script using curl:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```

moreover, execute it afterward:

```bash
sh get-docker.sh
```

The installation should look like this:

![Docker installation process](images/docker_install.png)

Now we only have to install docker-compose, for this we simply download the binary:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

So make them executable afterward:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Now we can check if everything has is installed correctly:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

it should look something like this:

![check if docker correctly installed](images/docker_check.png)

That was it already at preparation, and we proceed with the next step.



## Step 2 - Create our docker-compose file

To make it easier for us to manage Gitlab and updates later on, we use docker-compose to run our docker containers.

for this we now create our `docker-compose.yaml`:

```bash
mkdir gitlab 
touch gitlab/docker-compose.yaml
vim gitlab/docker-compose.yaml
```
> You can also use `nano` or any other text editor,  but i prefer `vim`.

In our case we use local docker volumes to persist our data. for this we use the root path `/srv/docker/volumes/`. of course you can change this path as well as most other settings. Basically, most of it is self-explanatory.

now we add / edit the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'
 
services:
  gitlab:
    image: 'gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest'
    container_name: gitlab
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: 'gitlab.your-domain.com'          # Change host here
    environment:
      GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
        external_url 'https://gitlab.your-domain.com'       # Change url here
        nginx['listen_port'] = 80
        nginx['listen_https'] = false
        nginx['proxy_set_headers'] = {
          "X-Forwarded-Proto" => "https",
          "X-Forwarded-Ssl" => "on"
        }
        # DATABASE CONNECTION SETTINGS: in our case we use postgresql as database
        gitlab_rails['db_adapter'] = "postgresql"
        gitlab_rails['db_database'] = "gitlab"
        gitlab_rails['db_username'] = "postgres"
        gitlab_rails['db_password'] = "CHANGE_TO_RANDOM_PASSWORD" # set the database password here
        gitlab_rails['db_host'] = "gitlab_database"
 
        # GITLAB DOCKER IMAGE REGISTRY: so that we can use our docker image registry with gitlab
        registry['enable'] = false # we do not activate this option because we provide our own registry
        gitlab_rails['registry_enabled'] = true
        gitlab_rails['registry_host'] = "registry.gitlab.your-domain.com"                       # Change registry host here
        gitlab_rails['registry_api_url'] = "https://registry.gitlab.your-domain.com"            # Change registry url here
        gitlab_rails['registry_issuer'] = "gitlab-issuer"
 
        # SMTP SETTINGS: So that gitlab can send emails. In our case we send via google mail.
        gitlab_rails['smtp_enable'] = true
        gitlab_rails['smtp_address'] = "smtp.gmail.com"
        gitlab_rails['smtp_port'] = 587
        gitlab_rails['smtp_user_name'] = "gitlab@your-domain.com"
        gitlab_rails['smtp_password'] = "xxxx"
        gitlab_rails['smtp_domain'] = "smtp.gmail.com"
        gitlab_rails['smtp_authentication'] = "login"
        gitlab_rails['smtp_enable_starttls_auto'] = true
        gitlab_rails['smtp_tls'] = false
        gitlab_rails['smtp_openssl_verify_mode'] = "peer"
    ports:
      - "2222:22"
    networks:

      - gitlab_net
    volumes:

    command:
        --configFile=/var/traefik/traefik.toml
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
      - "8090:8090"
    networks:
      - traefik_gitlab_net
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./traefik.toml:/var/traefik/traefik.toml:ro
      - /srv/docker/volumes/traefik/log:/log
 
networks:
  traefik_gitlab_net:
  gitlab_net:
```

All processed? That's it, and we can move on to the next step.

## Step 3 - Configure Traefik

Since we use traefik as a reverse proxy, we have to create a reason configuration file for it. All other settings for traefik we define in the docker-compose.yaml

```bash
vim gitlab/traefik.toml
```

now we add the following content:

```yaml
defaultEntryPoints = ["http", "https"]
 
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"
  [entryPoints.http.redirect]
    entryPoint = "https"
  [entryPoints.https]
  address = ":443"
    [entryPoints.https.tls]
 
[acme]
email = "acme@example.com" # please change this to the email address you want to use to apply for letsencrypt certificates.
storage = "acme.json"
entryPoint = "https"
OnHostRule = true
acmeLogging = true
[acme.httpChallenge]
  entryPoint = "http"
 
## if you want you can activate an access to the traefik dashbord here. You can then access the dashboard at http://gitlab.your-domain.com:8090
#[web]
#address = ":8090"
#[web.auth.basic]
#users = ["user:encryped_password"]
 
[docker]
endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
watch = true
exposedbydefault = false
```

> Don't forget to make the DNS entries for your domain. Otherwise, the certificate can't be issued in the next step (we use HTTP validation).

## Step 4 - Let's try to start the server

There's not much left. If the DNS entries point to our server, we can now continue with the following points.

First we switch to our gitlab directory, if we are not already there:

```bash
cd gitlab
```

Let's load all docker images which we need:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Start everything:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If we did everything right, the Gitlab server, the database, the docker registry, and our reverse proxy should start now.

Gitlab itself needs some time for the bootstrap process. We can check the status with `docker ps`




![docker ps check if containers are running](images/docker_ps.png)
> (health: starting) should switch to (healthy)

Don't wonder if the registry container is hanging in a restart loop; we'll get to that in Step 5.

When everything is ready, what we need in this step, we should reach gitlab at gitlab.your-domain.com. Now we can go to the next step.



## Step 5: Prepare the registry

For Gitlab and our Docker Image Registry to communicate with each other, we need a shared certificate. The good thing is, gitlab creates a key for us at bootstrap, only the registry doesn't know about it yet.

What we have to do is copy the certificate key created by gitlab into the volume of the registry and create a certificate out of it. Lets do it:

```
cd /srv/docker/volumes/registry/certs/
docker cp gitlab:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc/gitlab-registry.key .
openssl req  -key gitlab-registry.key -new -subj "/CN=gitlab-issuer" -x509 -days 365 -out gitlab-registry.crt
```

after a minute the docker image registry should now be running, and we can use it with gitlab.


## Conclusion

We can now reach Gitlab at `gitlab.your-domain.com`. At the beginning we are asked to assign a password, the default user is root. I recommend to create a new user and deactivate root after the first login.

Now have fun with your Gitlab server!

#### Appendix: Updating Gitlab

Since we use the image tag `:latest` in our `docker-compose.yaml` at Gitlab, we only have to perform the following steps for an update.

```bash
cd /gitlab
docker-compose pull     # download the current image from the docker hub image registry
docker-compose up -d    # replaces the containers with a new image.
```

> Gitlab needs a little time to start again; then you should be working on the latest version.
