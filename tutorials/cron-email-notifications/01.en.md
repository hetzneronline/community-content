# Cronjob e-mail notifications with ssmtp

## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to setup ssmtp in order to receive email notifications from your server. This makes it possible to get the output of a cronjob via email.  

**Prerequisites**

* A email account that will send the emails

## Step 1 - Connect to your server

If you already have a server you should connect to it via SSH.  

## Step 2- Install ssmtp

Now you should install ssmtp. You can do that by running:
`apt update && apt install -y ssmtp`

## Step 3 - Update the ssmtp configuration

Now you need to update the ssmtp configuration. The configuration files can be found under `/etc/ssmtp`.  
Use `nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to open the config in a editor.  

Now you have to add some lines the final config should then look like this:

```
root=yourownemail@example.com
mailhub=mail.example.com:465
FromLineOverride=NO
UseSTARTTLS=YES                    # Does your email server support start tls if no simply change this to NO
UseTLS=YES                         # Does your email server support tls if no simply change this to NO
AuthUser=senderemail@example.com
AuthPass=password
rewriteDomain=yourdomain.com
hostname=senderemail@example.com
```

When that is done you will have to edit use `nano /etc/ssmtp/revaliases` to edit the `revaliases` config. The config should look like this when you are done:

```
# sSMTP aliases
#
# Format:       local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
#
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]
# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.

root:senderemail@example.com:mail.example.com:465
```

## Step 4 - Setup the a cronjob

Now you can setup a cronjob with `crontab -e` then choose the editor you like (for example nano). There you have to add `MAILTO=yourownemail@example.com` above your cron jobs. Now you will get a email when ever a cronjob runs.

## Step 5 - Exclude a cronjob from email sending

If you don't want one cron job to send you emails you can simply add a `>/dev/null 2>&1` to its end. This will redirect the output of that job to `/dev/null` and no email will be send.
