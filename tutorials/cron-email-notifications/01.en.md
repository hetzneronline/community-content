# Cronjob e-mail notifications with ssmtp

## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to setup ssmtp in order to receive email notifications from your server. This makes it possible to get the output of a cronjob via email.  

**Prerequisites**

* A email account that will send the emails

## Step 1 - Connect to your server

If you already have a server you should connect to it via SSH.  

## Step 2- Install ssmtp

Now you should install ssmtp. You can do that by running:
`apt update && apt install -y ssmtp`

## Step 3 - Update the ssmtp configuration

Now you need to update the ssmtp configuration. The configuration files can be found under `/etc/ssmtp`.  
Use `nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to open the config in an editor.  

Now you have to add some lines the final config, when you are done it should look like this:  

```
root=yourownemail@example.com
mailhub=mail.example.com:465
FromLineOverride=NO
UseSTARTTLS=YES                    # Does your email server support start tls if no simply change this to NO
UseTLS=YES                         # Does your email server support tls if no simply change this to NO
AuthUser=senderemail@example.com
AuthPass=password
rewriteDomain=yourdomain.com
hostname=senderemail@example.com
```

Once that is done you will need to edit `/etc/ssmtp/revaliases` you can use `nano /etc/ssmtp/revaliases` to edit the file.  
The config should look like this when you are done editing:  

```
# sSMTP aliases
#
# Format:       local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
#
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]
# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.

root:senderemail@example.com:mail.example.com:465
```

## Step 4 - Setup the a cronjob

Now you can setup an cronjob with `crontab -e` then choose the editor you like (for example nano).  
Before your cronjobs you have to add `MAILTO=yourownemail@example.com`.  
Now you will get an email when ever a cronjob runs.

## Step 5 - Exclude a cronjob from email sending

If you don't want one cron job to send emails you can simply add a `>/dev/null 2>&1` to its end. This will redirect the output of that job to `/dev/null` and no email will be send.

## Conclusion

With ssmtp configured on your server, you will now get emails for every cronjob. This can be super helpful for example if you are auto upgrading some services on your machine. But it can also be annoying. If you for example have a cronjob that runs very minute you will get a email every minute which is definitely going to be annoying at some point. So before you start using this feature you should carefully consider if you need it.
