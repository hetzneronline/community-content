## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to install a private Node.js registry using [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/docs/what-is-verdaccio "Visit") on a secure Fedora instance in the [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud "Open") infrastructure.

> _**NOTE:** All below commands assume you have root privileges, so you will have to either run the commands with the `sudo` prefix, or act in the name of root user with the command `$ su root -`._

**Prerequisites**

* Hetzner account with access to Cloud and DNS Console
* Secure Fedora cloud instance
* Nginx installed with custom configuration
* Node.js runtime installed
* Basic understanding of Node.js packages

> _**NOTE:** This tutorial builds on the setup we created in [Setting Up a Secure Fedora Webserver](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/secure-fedora-webserver "Open") and [Nginx authentication preflight request with Node.js backend](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/nginx-auth-preflight-nodejs-api "Open"). The Nginx setup will heavily back-reference the latter._

## Step 0 - Ensure Dependencies

```shell
$ sestatus                                  # Ensure SELinux is running in 'enforcing' mode
$ service nginx status                      # Ensure nginx is running
$ dnf repolist | grep --color nodesource    # Ensure we have `nodesource` repository present
$ node --version                            # Check Node.js version
$ npm --version                             # Check npm version
```

## Step 1 - Install Verdaccio

To install Verdaccio as a global package, run:

```shell
$ npm install --location global verdaccio
$ npm ls --location global --depth 0        # To ensure global package is present
```

## Step 2 - Create Systemd Service

To create a `systemd` service, create the file `/etc/systemd/system/verdaccio.service` with the contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Verdaccio Node.js repository
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
User=nobody
ExecStart=verdaccio --config /usr/local/etc/verdaccio.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> _**NOTE:** We will start the service in a later step, when all configuration is done._

## Step 3 - Verdaccio Configuration

Next we need to create the before mentioned `yaml` file, which `systemd` has permission to read (granted by SELinux). Create the file `/usr/local/etc/verdaccio.yml` with the contents:

```yml
listen: localhost:<port>                      # Listen on localhost only
storage: /usr/tmp/verdaccio-storage           # Where to store the database file
web:
  enable: false                               # We do not want to use the web frontend for now
auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: /usr/local/etc/verdaccio.htpasswd   # The htpasswd file location
    algorithm: bcrypt                         # Set the cryptographic algorithm
    rounds: 8
    max_users: -1                             # Do not allow registering users
security:
  api:
    jwt:
      sign:
        expiresIn: 15d
        notBefore: 0
packages:
  '@<scope>/*':                               # Packages with this scope will only exist locally
    access: "@authenticated"
    publish: "@authenticated"
    unpublish: "@authenticated"
  '**': {}                                    # Any other packages will be blocked by default
```

> _**NOTE:** Here you might decide to use a 3rd party authentication plugin, or even write your own in a production scenario._ 
> _**SEE:** [Verdaccio documentation: Package access](https://verdaccio.org/docs/packages "Visit")_

## Step 4 - Adding Users

Now we need to create the `htpasswd` file, for that we'll need to install `httpd-tools` with the command:

```shell
$ yum install -y httpd-tools
```

After successful install we can invoke the `htpasswd` command to create our file, and to add any more users:

```shell
$ htpasswd -c -B -b -C 8 /usr/local/etc/verdaccio.htpasswd admin <password>     # Create new file with first user
$ htpasswd -B -b -C 8 /usr/local/etc/verdaccio.htpasswd <user> <password>       # Add more user(s) to the existing file
```

## Step 5 - Finalizing

We also need to tell `npm` about our intentions to lock our `@<scope>` scoped packages to our registry running on `localhost`:

```shell
$ npm config set @<scope>:registry localhost:<port>
$ cat ~/.npmrc
```

Now that we set up everything, it is time to fire up our server with the commands:

```shell
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl enable --now verdaccio.service
```

## Step 6 - Logging in

To acquire a login token, run the commands:

```shell
$ npm login --scope @<scope> --registry http://localhost:<port>
$ cat ~/.npmrc
```

## Step 7 - Publishing a Private Package

Create a Node.js package in your file system, be sure, to give it a name starting with your predefined `@<scope>/`:

```shell
mkdir /usr/local/lib/private-test
cd /usr/local/lib/private-test
npm init
chmod +x index.js
npm install
```

Now edit the newly created `/usr/local/lib/private-test/package.json`, and add the following lines under the `main` entry:

```jsonc
  "bin": {
    "private-test-cli": "index.js"
  },
```

Edit `index.js` to have the following contents:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log("@<scope>/<package-name> working");
```

Next we can try a `dry-run` publish in our `/usr/local/lib/private-test` directory, and if everything looks fine, a real one too:

```shell
$ npm publish --dry-run
$ npm publish
```

Ensure, that our published package is present in Verdaccio's storage:

```shell
$ find /usr/tmp/verdaccio-storage | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\// |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-\1/"
```

## Step 8 - Installing Our Private Package

Now we can try to install our locally existing package, simplest to add it globally:

```shell
$ npm install --location global @<scope>/<package-name>
$ npm ls --location global --depth 0
```

If we can see our `@<scope>/<package-name>` listed, we can be sure, that it was installed from our local registry, thus we secured our `@<scope>` scope.

We can try out our executable as well:

```shell
$ private-test-cli  # Should print '@<scope>/<package-name> working'
```

## Step 9 - Cleanup

If everything went well, we can remove our test resources (assuming we are still in the `/usr/local/lib/private-test` directory):

```shell
$ npm uninstall --location global @<scope>/<package-name>
$ npm ls --location global --depth 0
$ npm unpublish --force
$ find /usr/tmp/verdaccio-storage | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\// |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-\1/"
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf private-test
```

## Step 10 - Publish our Registry

We will now create a `registry.<your-domain>` subdomain, for that we need:

>_**NOTE:** Most of these steps we already covered in a [previous article](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/nginx-auth-preflight-nodejs-api "Open"), so this time only bullet-points will be listed, feel free to use the old article as reference._

1. Create a DNS `A` entry containing `registry` in the `<your-domain>` zone in [Hetzner DNS Console](https://dns.hetzner.com/ "Open"):

2. Create an Nginx server block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/registry.<your-domain>.conf`:
   ```nginx
   server {
       include /etc/nginx/shared.d/server/http.conf;
   
       server_name registry.<your-domain>;
   }
   
   server {
       include /etc/nginx/site.d/<your-project>/server/https.conf;
       include /etc/nginx/shared.d/server/https.conf;
   
       server_name registry.<your-domain>;
   
       location /api/ {
           include /etc/nginx/site.d/<your-project>/location/cors.conf;
           include /etc/nginx/shared.d/location/proxy.conf;
   
           # auth_request off;
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3340/;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Create static content (optional):
   ```shell
   $ mkdir -p /var/www/registry.<your-domain>/html
   $ semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/var/www/registry.<your-domain>/html(/.*)?"
   $ touch /var/www/registry.<your-domain>/html/index.html
   ...
   $ restorecon -Rv /var/www/registry.<your-domain>/html
   ```

4. Enable the subdomain:
   ```shell
   $ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/registry.<your-domain>.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/registry.<your-domain>.conf
   $ nginx -t
   $ service nginx restart
   ```

## Step 11 - Access our Registry

From now on you can access your secure Node.js registry from any of your devices (just be sure to properly set up scope based registries in `.npmrc`):

```shell
$ npm config set @<scope>:registry https://registry.<your-domain>
$ npm login --scope @<scope> --registry https://registry.<your-domain>
```

## Conclusion

Now you can publish and unpublish your `@<scope>` scoped packages to / from your private npm registry running on your webserver, without having to worry about publishing them publicly to `npmjs`.
