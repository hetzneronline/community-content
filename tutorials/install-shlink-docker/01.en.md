## Introduction

This tutorial is about the installation of the selfhosted URL shortener __Shlink__ as a Docker Container

More Information about Shlink can be found in the [Shlink documentation](https://shlink.io/documentation/ "Shlink documentation")

**Prerequisites**

* (Cloud-)Server with Debian
  * [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)
  * [Hetzner Cloud Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/)
  * [Tutorial Debian](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/)
* Docker already installed
  * [Tutorial Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
* Docker Compose installed at `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
  * [Tutorial Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* if required, a reverse proxy can be used to e.g. use multiple domains and encrypt the requests (the service does not provide encryption by itself)
  * [Tutorial Caddy Reverse Proxy](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/caddy-as-simple-reverse-proxy-and-file-server)
  * [Tutorial Nginx Reverse Proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)
  * [Tutorial Apache Reverse Proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html)
* if a publicly accessible (sub-)domain is to be used, the DNS settings must be adjusted accordingly
  * [Hetzner DNS Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/de/dns-console/dns/general/dns-overview/)

## Step 1 - Create directory structure

First we create the directories for the configuration and database files

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/shlink/db_data/
```

## Step 2 - Create docker-compose.yml

In the `docker-compose.yml` we define all settings for our Docker containers

```bash
nano /opt/shlink/docker-compose.yml
```

We have to consider a few variables that we still have to adjust:

- `DEFAULT_DOMAIN`: Here we have to specify the domain through which the Shlink instance will be accessible
- `IS_HTTPS_ENABLED`: If a reverse proxy with TLS termination is installed (technology to be able to use https), `true` must be entered here, otherwise `false`
- `GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY`: The Geolite license key must be entered here, which we will receive in the [next step](#step-3---apply-for-a-geolite2-license-key)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: A secure password, preferably randomly generated, must be entered here
- `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`: A secure password, preferably randomly generated, must be entered here

The following applies to the variables under Ports:

- `127.0.0.1`: the `bind address` is entered here, i.e. the address via which the service should be accessible
  - `127.0.0.1` means that the service can only be reached locally, this would be used if a reverse proxy is connected
  - `0.0.0.0` means that the service can be accessed globally as long as the corresponding port is opened
- `8080`: the `bind port` is entered here, i.e. the port via which the service should be accessible
  - `80` would be used if you want to reach the service directly via http
  - `8080` or some other non-standard port would be used for a reverse proxy configuration

Shlink offers some more variables, which you can find in the [Shlink documentation](https://shlink.io/documentation/environment-variables/ "Shlink documentation")

`docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  shlink:
    image: shlinkio/shlink:stable
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ="Europe/Berlin"
      - DEFAULT_DOMAIN=<DEFAULT_DOMAIN>
      - IS_HTTPS_ENABLED=<true/false>
      - GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY=<GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY>
      - DB_DRIVER=maria
      - DB_USER=shlink
      - DB_NAME=shlink
      - DB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>
      - DB_HOST=database
    depends_on:
      - database
    ports:
      - <127.0.0.1>:<8080>:8080

  database:
    image: mariadb:10.8
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD>
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=shlink
      - MARIADB_USER=shlink
      - MARIADB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>
    volumes:
      - /opt/shlink/db_data:/var/lib/mysql

```

## Step 3 - Apply for a GeoLite2 license key

- To assign a real address to the IP addresses, we need a corresponding database
- The provider MAXMIND provides the database `GeoLite2` __free__ in addition to commercial services
- To use this service we need a license key

You can get this by following these steps:

1. Create an [Account for GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup "Maxmind")
2. Generate a [license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key "Maxmind")

Don't forget to put this key in the [variable](#step-2---create-docker-composeyml) as well!

## Step 4 - Start service

To start the Docker container we use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the Docker container we use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

We can see the status of the containers with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

- Everything should be `Up` in `Status`!

To get a deeper insight, you can see the logs with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

### Note

You should now be able to access your Shlink instance

If you go to your URL and don't have a redirect specified by the `DEFAULT_BASE_URL_REDIRECT` [variable](#step-2---create-docker-composeyml), a 404 page should appear

Now you can use the [CLI (console command)](#step-5---cli-optional), [Rest API](#step-6---rest-api-optional) or [web client](#step-7---shlink-web-client-optional) to create and manage new `short codes`, i.e. URL abbreviations, and view their statistics

## Step 5 - CLI commands (Optional)

This console command allows you to interact directly with your instance

```bash
docker-compose exec shlink shlink <arguments>
```

By omitting arguments you get a help with all available commands

## Step 6 - Rest API (Optional)

Shlink provides a rest API through which you can control your instance alongside the CLI.
This requires an API key, which you can generate with a console command:

```bash
docker-compose exec shlink shlink api-key:generate
```

You can find a list of API endpoints [here](https://api-spec.shlink.io/ "API endpoints")

## Step 7 - Shlink Web Client (Optional)

- You've probably asked yourself whether you always have to control everything via the [CLI (console command)](#step-5---cli-optional) or the [Rest API](#step-6---rest-api-optional)
  - Again, Shlink offers a clever help
  - You can use the Shlink web client to create and manage 'short codes', i.e. URL abbreviations, and view their statistics
- To use it, you can just use the [official WebApp](https://app.shlink.io/)
- Even if your data is safe because it is only processed in the browser, you can also host it yourself
  - You can simply add the following part to your `docker-compose.yml`
  - Make sure that you set the `bind address` and the `bind port` again so that you can reach the web client either directly or via reverse proxy

```yml
  shlink-web-client:
    image: shlinkio/shlink-web-client
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /opt/shlink/servers.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/servers.json
    ports:
      - <127.0.0.1>:<8081>:80
```

### Note

If you want to use the [official WebApp](https://app.shlink.io/) and/or want to secure your own web client through https, you also have to connect a reverse proxy with TLS termination to your Shlink instance, because you cannot access http pages via https pages for security reasons.

More information is available [here](https://web.dev/what-is-mixed-content/)

## Summary

You now have a fully functional Shlink instance that you can use to create shortcuts for your URLs.
Shlink also offers many other practical features.
Just have a look at the [Shlink documentation](https://shlink.io/documentation/ "Shlink documentation") or try the [CLI](#step-5---cli-optional), [Rest API](#step-6---rest-api-optional) or [web client](#step-7---shlink-web-client-optional).
