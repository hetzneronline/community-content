## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to run a Python Flask app on Hetzner Webhosting or Hetzner Managed Server. Flask is a python web framework. By default it runs on WSGI (interface between webserver and application), but `mod_wsgi` is not available on the managed Apache server. Nevertheless, there are different ways to convert the WSGI to other compatible interfaces.
 
**Prerequisites**

- [Webhosting](https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting?country=ot) with SSH support (>= Level 9) or [Managed Server](https://www.hetzner.com/managed-server?country=ot) with enabled SSH access

## Step 1 - Install dependencies

### Step 1.1 - Install and enable virtualenv 

```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages virtualenv
mkdir /usr/home/holu/virtualenvs
python3 -m virtualenv /usr/home/holu/virtualenvs/example_com
. /usr/home/holu/virtualenvs/example_com/bin/activate
```

### Step 1.2 - Install Flask

Install the framework Flask.

```bash
pip install flask
```

### Step 1.3 - Install Flup (Optional, required for FastCGI)

Install the wsgi-to-fcgi flup server.

```bash
pip install flup
```

## Step 2 - Create your Flask project

Create the project directory and your Flask app with the content below.

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/home/holu/flaskprojects/example_com
vim /usr/home/holu/flaskprojects/example_com/flaskapp.py
```

Hit `i` to switch to "insert mode" and add this:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def itworks():
  html = """<html>
  <head>
  <title>It works!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>It works!<h1>
  </body>
  </html>"""
  return html

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run()
```

Hit `esc` the switch back to "command mode" and enter `:wq` to save and exit.

## Step 3 - Prepare document root of webserver

Create an empty website directory and change the document root in konsoleH.

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com
```

### Step 3 Option 1 - FastCGI

#### Create .htaccess

Create `.htaccess` with the content below.

```bash
vim /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/.htaccess
```

Hit `i` to switch to "insert mode".

```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ flaskapp.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

Hit `esc` the switch back to "command mode" and enter `:wq` to save and exit.

#### Create the ".fcgi"-script

Create `flaskapp.fcgi` with the content below.

```bash
vim /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/flaskapp.fcgi
```

```python
#!/usr/home/holu/virtualenvs/example_com/bin/python

import sys
from flup.server.fcgi import WSGIServer
from flaskapp import app

sys.path.append('/usr/home/holu/flaskprojects/example_com')

class ScriptNameStripper(object):
  def __init__(self, app):
    self.app = app

  def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
    environ['SCRIPT_NAME'] = ''
    return self.app(environ, start_response)

app = ScriptNameStripper(app)

WSGIServer(app).run()
```

Set the executable bit for the owner.

```bash
chmod 744 /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/flaskapp.fcgi
```

### Step 3 Option 2 - CGI

#### Create .htaccess

Create `.htaccess` with the content below.

```bash
vim /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/.htaccess
```

Hit `i` to switch to "insert mode".

```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ flaskapp.cgi/$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

Hit `esc` the switch back to "command mode" and enter `:wq` to save and exit.

#### Create ".cgi"-script

Create `flaskapp.cgi` with the content below.

```bash
vim /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/flaskapp.cgi
```

```python
#!/usr/home/holu/virtualenvs/example_com/bin/python

import sys
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
from flaskapp import app

sys.path.append('/usr/home/holu/flaskprojects/example_com')

class ScriptNameStripper(object):
  def __init__(self, app):
    self.app = app

  def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
    environ['SCRIPT_NAME'] = ''
    return self.app(environ, start_response)

app = ScriptNameStripper(app)

CGIHandler().run(app)
```
Set the executable bit for the owner.

```bash
chmod 744 /usr/home/holu/public_html/example_com/flaskapp.cgi
```

## Step 4 - Test

Test it by visiting your domain. You should see something like on the screenshot below.

## Conclusion

Now you can deploy your Flask apps on the managed OS.
