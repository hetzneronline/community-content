## Introduction

This tutorial will help you to create servers with an API key via one click on Windows OS and without the need of logging into the Hetzner [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/).

**Prerequisites**

- **Basic knowledge about _batch scripting_**
  
  You may need to get some basic information about _batch scripting_, but you can safely continue the tutorial without reading any resources.

- **`curl` has to be installed**
  
  Before starting this tutorial, you have to check if your system runs _cURL_. 
  
  The formal way to check it, is to run the command `curl --version` in a terminal session. It should return something like:
  
  ```bash
  curl 7.83.1 (Windows) libcurl/7.83.1 Schannel
  Release-Date: 2022-05-13
  Protocols: dict file ftp ftps http https imap imaps pop3 pop3s smtp smtps telnet tftp
  Features: AsynchDNS HSTS IPv6 Kerberos Largefile NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI UnixSockets
  ```
  
  If you don't have it, you should see:
  
  ```bash
  'curl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.
  ```

If you don't have cURL installed on your system, you can download it here: https://curl.se/download.html

## Step 1 - Open PowerShell /  Terminal

Right click to an empty space in a folder while pressing the shift key. Then, select the option "Open PowerShell..." or "Open Terminal here".

Create a new `.bat` file and open it with notepad:

```
start cmd
echo.>create-server.bat
notepad create-server.bat
```

We are starting by disabling verbose mode and text color:

```bash
@echo off
title Creating...
SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
color D
```

Below this, add the commands from step 2.

## Step 2 - Set your variables

Go to [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) > Your Project > Security. Create an API token with "Read & Write" permissions. Then, add your SSH key and choose a name for it. 

In the commands below, replace `your-api-token` with the API token you created, and `your-ssh-key` with the name you chose for your SSH key.

```bash
set APITOKEN=your-api-token
set SSHkey=your-ssh-key
set ServerName=myserver
set start_after_create=true
set server_type=cx21
set datacenter=nbg1-dc3
```

Below this, add the commands from step 3.

## Step 3 - Check for your snapshots and images

```bash
"%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\curl.exe" -H "Authorization: Bearer %APITOKEN%" "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/images" | findstr /r /c:"description"
"%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\curl.exe" -H "Authorization: Bearer %APITOKEN%" "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/images" | findstr /r /c:"""id"""
echo.
set snapshotIDstatic=111
set /P snapshotIDstatic=Select snapshot ID: 
cls
```

- The first command prints the names of your snapshots and images.
- The second command prints the IDs of those snapshots and images.

When you create your server in step 7, the `snapshotIDstatic` variable will prompt you to enter the ID of the snapshot or image you want to use.

Now, add the commands from step 4.

## Step 4 - Check for internet connectivity

Check if Internet access is available, otherwise the script may output false info. If no internet access is detected, exit the script immediately.

```
set internet=0
ping 8.8.8.8 -n 1 -w 3000|findstr /V /i "pinging statistics approx minimum packets"
if errorlevel 1 (set internet=0) else (set internet=1)
if %internet%==0 (echo No Internet Connection!) else (echo Internet connection established.&&goto resume)
echo.
pause
exit

:resume
cls
echo.
echo.
echo.
```

Below this, add the commands from step 5.

## Step 5 - Check if the snapshot or image is available on your account

If the snapshot ID doesn't exist on your account, inform the user and exit.

```
set abc1=0
set abc2=0
set abctemp=0
set snapshotID=0


set staticFound=0
if %snapshotIDstatic% LSS 102 (set snapshotIDstatic=11111111)
for /f "delims=" %%a in ('%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\curl.exe -H "Authorization: Bearer %APITOKEN%" "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/images" ^| findstr /r /c:"""id"""') do (
set abc2=!abc1!
set abctemp=%%a
if "!abctemp:~12,1!" NEQ ":" (set abc1=%%a)
if !abc1:~12^,8!==!snapshotIDstatic! (set staticFound=1)
)

  set snapshotID=!abc2:~12,8!
  if %staticFound%==1 (set snapshotID=%snapshotIDstatic%)

if %snapshotID%==0 (echo Snapshot id couldnt get...&&pause&&exit)

echo.


cls


"%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\curl.exe" -H "Authorization: Bearer %APITOKEN%" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"name\": \"%ServerName%\", \"datacenter\":\"%datacenter%\", \"server_type\": \"%server_type%\", \"start_after_create\":%start_after_create%, \"image\": \"%snapshotID%\", \"ssh_keys\":[\"%SSHkey%\"]}" -X POST "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers"|findstr ip
echo.
echo.
echo.
```

Below this, add the commands from step 6.

## Step 6 - Wait for user activity

Inform the user if the creation of the server was successful or not, and wait for input from the user.

```
echo.
echo Snapshot id %snapshotID% created at: %time:~0,5%
echo.
echo SSH username: root
echo.
echo SSH Password: example
echo.
set /p DUMMY=Press enter key to exit...
```

You can now save and close the file.

## Step 7 - Create the server

After you saved the file, run this command:

```
create-server.bat
```

You will be asked to select an image and the new server will be created with the name you specified in step 2.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you learned how to create a server from a snapshot or image by simply clicking a desktop shortcut. You may want to dive deeper into "*batch scripting*" to develop custom scripts.

Hope it helps.
