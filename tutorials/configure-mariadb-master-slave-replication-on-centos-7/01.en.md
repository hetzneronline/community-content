## Introduction

This tutorial will be showing you how to set up MariaDB master-slave replication on CentOS 7. MariaDB is a mature, stable, open-source relational database forked from MySQL. Replication is a feature in MariaDB that allows data on one server to be mirrored on another server.

MariaDB replication is based on the **binary log (binlog)**. The purpose of binary log is to allow replication, backup and restoration of databases.

**Prerequisites**

To use this tutorial, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

Our testing environment consists of the following machines (both are CentOS 7):

```bash
Master: 192.168.0.20
Slave: 192.168.0.30
```

## Step 1 - Installing MariaDB

To install the latest version of MariaDB, we will need to add their repositories to our servers. If youâ€™re using an older version of MariaDB, like say 5.5, consider upgrading to the latest 10.4.5 version using this tutorial.

Create a file named `MariaDB.repo` inside `/etc/yum.repos.d` with the following contents on both Master and Slave systems:

```bash
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/MariaDB.repo
```

```bash
# MariaDB 10.4.5 CentOS repository list - created 2019-May-21 11:42:15
# http://mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
baseurl = http://yum.mariadb.org/10.4.5/centos7-amd64
gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck=1
```

Save the file and install MariaDB on both servers using yum:

```bash
yum install mariadb-server mariadb-client
```

Then, start and enable MariaDB service:

```bash
systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb
```

## Step 2 - Setting Up a Sample MySQL Database on Master

We will now set up the **exampledb** database on the master server:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
MariaDB [(none)]> USE exampledb;
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE TABLE authors (id INT, name VARCHAR(20), email VARCHAR(20));
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
```

## Step 3 - Configuring MySQL Server on Master

To configure the master, edit the `/etc/my.cnf` file. Under the `[mysqld]` section, add the following four lines:

```bash
vi /etc/my.cnf
```

```bash
[mysqld]
log-bin
server_id=1
replicate-do-db=exampledb
bind-address=192.168.0.20
```

Then, restart MariaDB service:

```bash
systemctl restart mariadb
```

Log on to the MariaDB server as root, create the user slave and assign the necessary grants:

```bash
mysqld -u root -p
```

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'slave'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SlavePassword';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO slave IDENTIFIED BY 'SlavePassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
```

Example Output:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'slave'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SlavePassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.006 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO slave IDENTIFIED BY 'SlavePassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.002 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.006 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+-------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File              | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+-------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| master-bin.000003 |      812 |              |                  |
+-------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> exit
Bye
```

Note down the file **master-bin.000003** and position number **812**, you need these values later.

### Step 4 - Backup Master server database and transfer it to the Slave

Enter the following command to dump **exampledb** databases and save them. We will transfer these databases to Slave server later:

```bash
mysqldump exampledb -u root -p > exampledb.sql
```

This will create a file called **exampledb.sql** in your current working directory. This will take some time depending upon the databases size.

Again login to MySQL as root user:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> UNLOCK TABLES;
MariaDB [(none)]> quit;
```

Copy the exampledb.sql file to your Slave server.

Here, I am going to copy this file to the **/root/** folder of my slave server. So the command will be:

```bash
scp exampledb.sql root@192.168.0.30:/root/
```

Run the `mysql_upgrade` procedure to upgrade the system tables (you will be prompted to enter the MariaDB root password):

```bash
mysql_upgrade -u root -p
```

Remember, 192.168.0.30 is your MariaDB slave server IP address.

## Step 5 - Configuring MySQL Server on Slave

To configure the slave, connect to the local MariaDB server with:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Once connected to the database server, create the user and an empty database, and grant permissions:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE exampledb;
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'slave'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SlavePassword';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'slave'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit the MariaDB prompt with `exit;` and load the dump created in the master server:

```bash
mysql -u root -p exampledb < exampledb.sql
```

Edit the `/etc/my.cnf` file to assign a server **ID** to the slave under the `[mysqld]` section. Note that it needs to be a different integer than 1, as we used 1 in the master:

```bash
[mysqld]
server_id=2
replicate-do-db=exampledb
```

Restart the database server:

```bash
systemctl restart mariadb
```

Run the `mysql_upgrade` procedure to upgrade the system tables (you will be prompted to enter the MariaDB root password):

```bash
mysql_upgrade -u root -p
```

Once the dump has been imported to the slave, we need only a few steps to begin replicating. Log on to the database and run the following commands in the MariaDB prompt. Pay special attention to the **MASTER_LOG_FILE** and **MASTER_LOG_POS** variables, which should match the values returned by SHOW MASTER STATUS in STEP 3 of "Configuring MySQL Server on Master" above.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='192.168.0.20',
  MASTER_USER='slave',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='SlavePassword',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='master-bin.000003',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=812,
  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10,
  MASTER_USE_GTID=current_pos;
```

Start the slave and check its status without exiting the MariaDB prompt:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> START SLAVE;
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
```

## Step 6 - Test MySQL/MariaDB Database Replication

Connect to the Master MariaDB server:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Add a record to the **exampledb** table in the master server:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> use exampledb;
MariaDB [(none)]> INSERT INTO authors (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'Your Name', 'email@example.com');
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
```

Then verify that this change was replicated in the slave:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> USE exampledb;
MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id=1;
```

Example Output:

```bash
MariaDB [exampledb]> SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id=1;
+------+-----------+-------------------+
| id   | name      | mail              |
+------+-----------+-------------------+
|    1 | Your Name | email@example.com |
+------+-----------+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

As you can see, replication is working correctly from master to slave.
