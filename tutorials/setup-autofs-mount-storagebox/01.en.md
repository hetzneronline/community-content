## Introduction

Before using BorgBackup I used Autofs for mounting the Hetzner Storage Box automatically and simply rsyncing data there and back. Even with the possibility of encrypting CIFS traffic with SMBv3, I am still used to sshfs, and am lazy enough to automate my mounts.

This tutorial will show you how to set up automatic mounting of a storage box. We will set up a folder /srv and its automatically mounted subfolder /srv/storagebox. The latter folder will be automatically mounted as soon as it is accessed and will be automatically unmounted after a while.

We will mount using [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) via [fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse). This is a special kind of mount which basically translates filesystem access over a ssh connection.

**Prerequisites**

Besides having a Linux server and a [Hetzner Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box), you will need to set up [SSH keys for the storage box](https://docs.hetzner.com/de/robot/storage-box/backup-space-ssh-keys/).

This tutorial is based on Debian/Ubuntu. It works the same on SUSE or RedHat based distros, though the package names could differ.

## Step 1 - Install packages

Install necessary packages. Use sudo or root.

```bash
$ apt install fuse sshfs autofs
```

## Step 2 - Prepare folders

```bash
$ mkdir /srv
```

We only create the base folder, NOT the folder that gets mounted automatically.

## Step 3 - Setup autofs

### Step 3.1 - Main configuration

The defaults are usually fine, there are three basic settings in `/etc/autofs.conf`:

```
master_map_name = etc/auto.master
```

The main config file which defines all maps (a map is basically one automount directory).

```
timeout = 300
```

Number of seconds of inactivity on the folder before it gets unmounted.

```
browse_mode = no
```

Disabling browse_mode hides the mount folders. E.g. if you do a `ls /srv` you won't see the folder `storagebox/`. After doing `ls /srv/storagebox`, it appears. Enabling browse mode will have an impact on performance of `ls`.

Please note that on RedHat based distros some of these settings are abstracted and defined in `/etc/sysconfig/autofs`!

### Step 3.2 - auto.master file

Even though you can place mappings in `/etc/auto.master.d` I personally prefer adding the entries directly to this file.

So simply add the following line *before* the last line `+auto.master`

```
/srv	/etc/auto.storagebox
```

This means that the map in `/etc/auto.storagebox` will be mounted in `/srv`.

### Step 3.3 - auto.storagebox file

The file `/etc/auto.storagebox` contains the folder to be mounted (relative to the base folder) and the mount options.

```
storagebox -fstype=fuse,rw,nodev,nonempty,noatime,allow_other,max_read=65536,IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_rsa_storagebox :sshfs\#iholu@holu.your-backup.de\:
```

The complete line explained:

* storagebox
  * The name of the folder where the storage box is mounted (/srv/storagebox)
* -fstype=fuse
  * User fuse as fstype, following are the mount options
* rw
  * ReadWrite access as opposed to ro, ReadOnly
* nodev
  * No special devices (e.g. /proc) can be seen on this mount. For security reasons, though probably not neccessary on the storagebox.
* nonempty
  * Mount can even work if the target folder is not empty
* noatime
  * sshfs does not handle atime (time of last access of a file) properly
* allow_other
  * All users, not just root, can use the mounted folder
* max_read=65536
  * Maximum size of a read request.
* IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_rsa_storagebox
  * The ssh file used to access the storage box (See prerequisites)

## Step 4 - Start autofs

```
$ systemctl start autofs
```

## Step 5 - Test autofs

Simply `ls` the folder or `cd` to it

```
$ ls /srv/storagebox
```

```
$ cd /srv/storagebox
```

You should now see the contents of the storage box.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial you have now set up automatic mounting of a Hetzner Storage Box.
