## Introduction

In This Tutorial You Will Learn How To Setup Your Own Terraria Server!

Note: This Tutorial Will Show You How To Host A Terraria 1.4.4.9 Server Software On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Operating System. It Will Work On Other OSes With apt Package Manager Too!

**Prerequisites**

* A VPS Server (Hetzner's CX11 and CPX11 Cloud Servers are good budget options!)
* Some time (About 5 Minutes)
* Basic Linux Knowledge

**Example terminology**

* `203.0.113.1` Â» Example Public IP Address 
   
----------------------------------

## Setting Up The Server!
 
* **Update Your System Packages**
  
  * Run  ```sudo apt update``` before doing anything else!
* **Install Required Packages**
  
  * ```sudo apt install -y wget tmux unzip```
  
 * **Download Server Software**
   * Go to [Terraria's Fandom Page](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Server#Downloads) And Select Your Server Software Version! Then Download It Using This Command: ```wget https://terraria.org/api/download/pc-dedicated-server/terraria-server-1449.zip```
   Once That's Done Extract It With The Following Command: ```unzip terraria-server-1449.zip```
   
* **Navigate To Server's Files!**
  * Use This Command To Navigate To Server's Files Folder!
  ```.
  cd 1449
  cd Linux
  ```
 * **Add Executeable Permissions And Run The Server** 
```.
sudo chmod +x TerrariaServer.bin.x86*
./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64
```
Now Let's Start Configuring The Server!

----------------------------------

## Configuring The Server!

* **First Time Setup!**
  
  * Once You Start The Server You Should See Something Like This!
```.

```

I Will Choose Small Size!

```.
Terraria Server v1.4.4.9

* **Running The Server**
  
  * If You Did Everything Correctly You Should See Something Like This.

## Running The Server In Background

* Open a new terminal!
* Run `sudo apt install screen -y` to install screen if you haven't installed screen already!
* Once screen installed just run `screen ./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64` to keep your server running in the background!

NB! (Do not do Ctrl+C if you wanna leave the terraria server view and get to the terminal view! It will shutdown the Terraria Server Software!)

### Shutting Down The Server Running In Background
