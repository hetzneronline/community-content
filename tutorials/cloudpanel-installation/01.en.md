## Introduction

This tutorial provides a complete walkthrough for installing the free and high-performance CloudPanel control panel on a Hetzner cloud server. You will learn how to create a server, install CloudPanel, set up a secure WordPress site, and use key management features.

---

## Prerequisites

- Hetzner Cloud account and access to the [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.com)
- Ubuntu 22.04 server (recommended by CloudPanel)
- SSH key for secure server access (recommended)
---

## Step 1: Create a Server on Hetzner

1. Log in to your **Hetzner Cloud Console**.
2. Click **Add Server**.
3. Configure your server:
   - **Location:** Choose a location close to your audience.
   - **Image:** Select **Ubuntu 22.04** from the OS Images tab.
   - **Type:** Choose a Standard plan (minimum: 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB disk; recommended: CPX11 or higher).
   - **SSH Key:** Add your SSH key for secure access (recommended). If not, Hetzner will email you the root password.
   - **Name:** Enter a name like `cloudpanel-vps`.
4. Click **Create & Buy Now**.

## Step 2: Install CloudPanel

1. Copy your server's public IP from the Hetzner dashboard.
2. Connect via SSH as root:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<your_server_ip>
   ```
3. Update your system and install prerequisites:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt -y upgrade && apt -y install curl wget sudo
   ```
4. (Recommended) Reboot the server:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```
   After reboot, reconnect via SSH.
5. Install CloudPanel (choose your database engine):
   - For MariaDB 10.8 (recommended):
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://installer.cloudpanel.io/ce/v2/install.sh | sudo CLOUD_HETZNER_DB_ENGINE=MARIADB_10.8 bash
     ```
   - For MySQL 8.0:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://installer.cloudpanel.io/ce/v2/install.sh | sudo CLOUD_HETZNER_DB_ENGINE=MYSQL_8.0 bash
     ```
   - For MariaDB 10.6:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://installer.cloudpanel.io/ce/v2/install.sh | sudo CLOUD_HETZNER_DB_ENGINE=MARIADB_10.6 bash
     ```
6. Wait for the installation to finish. The terminal will display the URL to access CloudPanel (e.g., `https://<your_server_ip>:8443`).

---

## Step 3: Initial CloudPanel Setup

1. Open the CloudPanel URL in your browser. You may see a security warning (self-signed SSL); proceed anyway.
2. Create your admin user (First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, Password, Timezone).
3. Agree to the terms and click **Create User**.

---

## Step 5: Secure Your Site with SSL

1. In the **Sites** tab, find your domain and click **Manage**.
2. Go to the **SSL/TLS** tab.
3. Ensure your domain's DNS records point to your server's IP (A record for root, A/CNAME for www).
4. Click **Actions** > **New Let's Encrypt Certificate**.
5. Confirm domains and click **Create and Install**.

---

## Step 6: Explore CloudPanel Features

- **Dashboard:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **File Manager:** Upload/edit files directly.
- **PHP Settings:** Change PHP version and settings per site.
- **PageSpeed Module:** Enable for on-the-fly optimizations.
- **Email Hosting:** CloudPanel does not include an email server. Use external services (e.g., Zoho Mail, Google Workspace) and update MX records.

---

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed CloudPanel on a Hetzner VPS, set up a WordPress site, secured it with SSL, and explored key management features. Your server is now ready for production use.
