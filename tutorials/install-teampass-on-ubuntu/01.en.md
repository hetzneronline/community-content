## Introduction

TeamPass is a password manager for sharing passwords among team members. It is accessible by web and the data base is encrypted. Teampass offers a large set of features permitting to manage your passwords and related data in an organized way in respect to the access rights defined for each user. Teampass is an Open-Source free to use product distributed in respect with OpenSource GNU GPL-3.0.

This tutorial explains how to install all the software needed in o server running Ubuntu.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run Teampass you will need:

* A server running Ubuntu 16.x/18.x
* Root access
* PHP 5.5.0 or higher
* MySQL or MariaDB 
* Apache
* PHP extensions: mcrypt, openssl, ldap (if used), mbstring, bcmath, iconv, xml, gd, openssl, mysqlnd, mysqli_fetch_all

It is recommended to have additional hardening tools on your cloud server:

* fail2ban
* Firewall

## Step 1 - Update the system

Firstly, after the server deployment, it is recommended to update the system.

```console
root@server# apt-get update
root@server# apt-get upgrade
```

Don't forgot to check the Teampass project page before updating your system in order to avoid upgrading php or mysql to unsupported versions. There is always an updating procedure.

## Step 2 - Install Apache and MySQL

Next step is to install Apache and MySQL. Remember that these services can be installed in other servers in order to split services in a scaled three layer architecture. In this tutorial it is going to be installed on a stand-alone server.

```console
root@server# apt-get install apache2
root@server# apt-get install mysql-server
```

This can take a while, but patience is a virtue.

### Step 2.1 - Configure MySQL database

Login to MySQL service.

```console
root@server# mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
```

Create a new and fresh database (the name can be different from the example given here).

```console
mysql> create database teampass;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

Next commands will create an user and grant privileges for the database.

```console
mysql> grant all privileges on teampass.* to teampassuser@localhost identified by 'yourpassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```

```console
mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```console
mysql> quit
Bye
```

## Step 3 - Install PHP and extensions

Now it is time to install PHP and the extensions.

```console
root@server# apt-get install php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-mbstring php7.1-fpm php7.1-common php7.1-xml php7.1-gd openssl php7.1-mysql php7.1-bcmath
```

It is good to check the version after the installation, it can be done like this:

```console
root@server# php -v
PHP 7.0.28-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 (cli) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.0.28-0ubuntu0.16.04.1, Copyright (c) 1999-2017, by Zend Technologies
```

Many times it is not needed, but it is a good practice to increase execution time value. Edit PHP.ini to increase 'max_execution_time' parameter.

```console
root@server# nano /etc/php7/apache2/php.ini
```

Increase the value from 30 to 120:

`max_execution_time = 120`

## Step 4 - Configure Apache

Get teampass and decompress it.

```console
root@server:~# cd /var/www/html
root@server:/var/www/html# wget -q https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/archive/master.zip
root@server:/var/www/html# unzip master.zip
```

Now it's time to set some folder permissions in order to write files.

```console
chmod -R 0777 teampass/includes/config
chmod -R 0777 teampass/includes/avatars
chmod -R 0777 teampass/includes/libraries/csrfp/libs
chmod -R 0777 teampass/includes/libraries/csrfp/log
chmod -R 0777 teampass/includes/libraries/csrfp/js
chmod -R 0777 teampass/backups
chmod -R 0777 teampass/files
chmod -R 0777 teampass/install
chmod -R 0777 teampass/upload
```

And of course a restart of the service in order to apply all the parameters.

```console
root@server:/var/www/html# service apache2 restart
```

check if Apache is running by typing:

```console
root@server:/var/www/html# service apache2 status
```

You should see something like this:

![Installation complete](images/12complete.png)

All the steps after that are informational so click Next until the page where "Installation complete" is shown and click Start button.

![Login page](images/13login.png)

This is the login screen.

After login with admin user, some folders and users can be created and then the credentials that are wanted to store.
