## Introduction

In this how-to you will learn to use the hcloud Terraform provider. This includes how to create and delete resources and how to do more complex scenarios like attaching a volume to a server.

 **Prerequisites**

* Basic knowledge about the Hetzner Cloud
* Hetzner Cloud API token
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is installed and you have basic knowledge about it

You can find general information about Hetzner Cloud server types, images and volumes in the [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/).

In order to create a Hetzner Cloud API token, please visit Hetzner Cloud Console at [https://console.hetzner.cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud), select your project, click "Access" on the left menu, switch to "API TOKENS" tab, click "GENERATE API TOKEN" button and follow the token creation master.

## Step 1 - Basic Usage

First of all, we create a new directory which will contain our Terraform configuration. We will call it `terraform` and create a new file there called `hcloud.tf`. You can name the file as you like.

```bash
mkdir terraform
touch hcloud.tf
```

You can now edit the `hcloud.tf` with a text editor of your choice.

You can find the complete documentation about the Terraform provider in the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/hcloud/).

We will first copy the `Example Usage` from the documentation.

```hcl
# Set the variable value in *.tfvars file
# or using the -var="hcloud_token=..." CLI option
variable "hcloud_token" {}

# Configure the Hetzner Cloud Provider
provider "hcloud" {
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
}

# Create a server
resource "hcloud_server" "web" {
  # ...
}
```

We will see, what the specific parts mean:

```hcl
# Set the variable value in *.tfvars file
# or using the -var="hcloud_token=..." CLI option
variable "hcloud_token" {}
```

We simply tell Terraform, that we will give it a variable called `hcloud_token`. You can specify the value of this variable by using a CLI option or by using a `terraform.tfvars` file. In this tutorial, we will use the `config.tfvars`-file. This file will contain our token.

```hcl
# Configure the Hetzner Cloud Provider
provider "hcloud" {
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
}
```

We tell Terraform, that we want to use the provider `hcloud`. Terraform will download the latest version of the provider plugin on `terraform init`. We also configure the `hcloud` provider plugin with the variable `hcloud_token`.

```hcl
# Create a server
resource "hcloud_server" "web" {
  # ...
}
```

This short snippet does basically nothing. It just defines a resource from type `hcloud_server` called `web`. But it won't work, because we didn't tell Terraform which server should be created.

So now you should create a `terraform.tfvars` -file which will contain the following content:

```text
hcloud_token = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

After this we will run `terraform init`. You should get a similar response to that below:

```text
* provider.hcloud: version = "~> 1.8"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the `hcloud` provider plugin!

## Step 2 - Create a server

You have now a basic overview of the `hcloud` Terraform provider, but of course, you want a more detailed view. So let's create a server.

We open our `hcloud.tf` file and go to the `resource "hcloud_server" "web"` section. We will replace it with the following snippet:

```hcl
# Create a server
resource "hcloud_server" "web" {
  name        = "my-server"
  image       = "ubuntu-18.04"
  server_type = "cx11"
}
```

This will create a new server with the name `my-server`, the image `ubuntu-18.04` and the server type `cx11`. When you now run `terraform apply` and confirm the message by typing `yes` ENTER, you should see a freshly created CX11 server in the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud)!
You should get a similar response like below:

```text
hcloud_server.web: Creating...
  backup_window: "" => "<computed>"
  backups:       "" => "false"
  datacenter:    "" => "<computed>"
  image:         "" => "ubuntu-18.04"
  ipv4_address:  "" => "<computed>"
  ipv6_address:  "" => "<computed>"
  ipv6_network:  "" => "<computed>"
  keep_disk:     "" => "false"
  location:      "" => "<computed>"
  name:          "" => "my-server"
  server_type:   "" => "cx11"
  status:        "" => "<computed>"
hcloud_server.web: Still creating... (10s elapsed)
hcloud_server.web: Still creating... (20s elapsed)
hcloud_server.web: Still creating... (30s elapsed)
hcloud_server.web: Creation complete after 30s (ID: 2035350)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Cool! You created your first Hetzner Cloud server with Terraform! You can now run `terraform destroy` and confirm this too, to remove the server.
You should get a response similar to this:

```text
hcloud_server.web: Refreshing state... (ID: 2035350)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  - hcloud_server.web

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

hcloud_server.web: Destroying... (ID: 2035350)
hcloud_server.web: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

## Step 3 - Create a volume and attach it to a server

You now have learned how to create a resource. Now I want to show you how easily you can create a bunch of resources and combine them. We will use a basic CX11 server and a volume in this step.

First of all, you should open your `hcloud.tf` file in an editor of your choice.

You should see something like this:

```hcl
# Set the variable value in *.tfvars file
# or using the -var="hcloud_token=..." CLI option
variable "hcloud_token" {}

# Configure the Hetzner Cloud Provider
provider "hcloud" {
  token = "${var.hcloud_token}"
}

# Create a server
resource "hcloud_server" "web" {
  name        = "my-server"
  image       = "ubuntu-18.04"
  server_type = "cx11"
}
```

Now we want to add a volume to this section, so we need to add a new `resource` block:

```hcl
# Create a volume
resource "hcloud_volume" "storage" {
  name       = "my-volume"
  size       = 50
  server_id  = "${hcloud_server.web.id}"
  automount  = true
  format     = "ext4"
}
```

This short snipped will create a new `volume` called `my-volume` with a size of `50 GB` and format it as `ext4`. It will automatically mount the volume on the server. We specified too, that it should be attached to the server `"${hcloud_server.web.id}"`, which will result in the ID of our server `my-server`.

When you now run `terraform plan`, you should see a similar response like below:

```text
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + hcloud_server.web
      id:            <computed>
      backup_window: <computed>
      backups:       "false"
      datacenter:    <computed>
      image:         "ubuntu-18.04"
      ipv4_address:  <computed>
      ipv6_address:  <computed>
      ipv6_network:  <computed>
      keep_disk:     "false"
      location:      <computed>
      name:          "my-server"
      server_type:   "cx11"
      status:        <computed>

  + hcloud_volume.volume
      id:            <computed>
      automount:     "true"
      linux_device:  <computed>
      location:      <computed>
      name:          "my-volume"
      server_id:     "0"
      size:          "50"


Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

When you now run `terraform apply` to apply those changes, you can see a volume with 50 GB storage. This is attached to your server in the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud).
