## Introduction

If you forget your root MySQL or MariaDB password, don't worry! It can be reset easily with this tutorial.

**Prerequisites**
To recover your MySQL or MariaDB password, make sure you have root access to the server.

## Step 1 - Stop the MySQL/MariaDB Service

Before you can reset the root password, you must first stop the MySQL/MariaDB service.

- For MySQL, use:
  ```console
  systemctl stop mysql
  ```

- For MariaDB, use:
  ```console
  systemctl stop mariadb
  ```

After that, you will access it manually to reset the root password.

## Step 2 - Restart MySQL/MariaDB

Now that the server is stopped, run the commands below to start it back up with the `--skip-grant-tables` option.
This bypasses the security measures (permission checking) put in place and allows for the root password to be reset.

```console
mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
```

The output for the correct run is similar to the following:

```text
mysqld_safe Logging to '/var/log/mysql/error.log'.
mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
```

If you see an error message like that:

```text
mysqld_safe Directory '/var/run/mysqld' for UNIX socket file don't exists.
```

please create the mentioned directory and change the owner of it:

```console
mkdir -v /var/run/mysqld
chown -v mysql /var/run/mysqld
```

After that, run `mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &` again.

## Step 3 - Log into the MySQL/MariaDB Shell

Now you can connect to the database server as the root user, without being asked for a password:

```console
mysql
```

## Step 4 - Set a New Root Password

To reload the grant table run the command below:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Now, you can change your MySQL/MariaDB password.

Run the following commands if you have MySQL 5.7.6 and newer or MariaDB 10.1.20 and newer:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<new_password>';
```

Run the following commands if you have MySQL 5.7.5 and older or MariaDB 10.1.20 and older:

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('<new_password>');
```

Make sure to replace `<new_password>` with your new password of choice.

You should see a confirmation that the command was executed successfully.

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Step 5 - Restart the Database Server

Stop the database server using the following command:

```console
mysqladmin -p shutdown
```

You will be prompted to enter the new root password.

Start the database server normally:

- For MySQL, use:
  ```console
  systemctl start mysql
  ```

- For MariaDB, use:
  ```console
  systemctl start mariadb
  ```

Now, you can confirm that the new password has been applied correctly by running:

```console
mysql -p
```

You will be prompted to enter the new root password.
Enter it, and you should be logged into your database server.

## Conclusion

Now, you know how to reset your MySQL/MariaDB root password.
Make sure your new root password is strong and secure and keep it in a safe place.
