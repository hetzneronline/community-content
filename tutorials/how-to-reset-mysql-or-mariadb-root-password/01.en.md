## Introduction

If you forget your root MySQL or MariaDB password, don't worry! It can be reset easily with this tutorial.

**Prerequisites**
To recover your MySQL or MariaDB password, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

## Step 1 - Stop the MySQL/MariaDB Service

Before you can reset the root password, you must first stop the MySQL/MariaDB service.

You can do that for MySQL with:

`sudo systemctl stop mysql`

And for MariaDB with:

`sudo systemctl stop mariadb`

After that, you will access it manually to reset the root password.

## Step 2 - Restart MySQL/MariaDB

Now that the server is stopped, run the commands below to start it back up with the `--skip-grant-tables` option. This bypasses the security measures (permission checking) put in place and allows for the root password to be reset.

`sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &`

## Step 3 - Log into the MySQL/MariaDB Shell

Now you can connect to the database server as the root user, without being asked for a password:

`mysql -u root`

## Step 4 - Set new Root Password

To reload the grant table run the command below:

`FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

Now, you can change your MySQL/MariaDB password.

Run the following commands if you have MySQL 5.7.6 and newer or MariaDB 10.1.20 and newer:

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';`

Run the following commands if you have MySQL 5.7.5 and older or MariaDB 10.1.20 and older:

`SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('new_password');`

Make sure to replace `new_password` with your new password of choice.

You shoud see confirmation that the command has been successfully executed.

`Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)`

## Step 5 - Restart the Database Server

Stop the database server using the following command:

`mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown`

You will be prompted to enter the new root password.

Start the database server normally:

For MySQL, use:

`sudo systemctl start mysql`

For MariaDB, use:

`sudo systemctl start mariadb`

Now you can confirm that the new password has been applied correctly by running:

`mysql -u root -p`

You will be prompted to enter the new root password. Enter it, and you should be logged into your database server.

## Conclusion

Now, you know how to reset your MySQL/MariaDB root password. Make sure your new root password is strong and secure and keep it in a safe place.
