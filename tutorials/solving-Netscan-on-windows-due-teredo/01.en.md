## Introduction


This tutorial aims to cover some configurations to perform in your windows firewall to prevent network abuse. This tutorial covers two important things,  blocking teredo* ports from sending packets to the internet and blocking private networks. There are various reasons you may want to do this. In my case,  I got an email from the abuse team of my provider, regarding a server of mine performing big amount of netscans. The logs had a lot of events that looked like this

```
> time                protocol src_ip src_port          dest_ip dest_port
> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>     	[some destination ip 1]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>      [some destination ip 2]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>   	[some destination ip 3]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>    	[some destination ip 4]  3544
> [DATE and time] TCP    [Your Server IP] 59762 =>      10.0.0.138[a private ip] 10983
```

The source port here is 59300, which is normal and this port SHOULD NOT BE blocked as other services use it to. The port 3544 is the port used by Teredo to listen (at the destination server), so your server sends requests to other servers on their 3544 port.  Additionally you may notice Private IPs in the list. It is better to block them as well. So we are going to deal with the 2 possible culprits for network abuse issues.

Teredo*: "Teredo is an IPv6 transition technology that provides address assignment and host-to-host automatic tunneling for unicast IPv6 traffic when IPv6/IPv4 hosts are located behind one or multiple IPv4 network address translators (NATs)." from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/teredo/portal#:~:text=Teredo%20is%20an%20IPv6%20transition,network%20address%20translators%20%28NATs%29.)
**Prerequisites**

- The steps are simple to follow, you only need to know how to login to an account with administrator priveleges.

## ## Step 0: Opening firewall configurations on windows server:
To Open the Windows Defender Firewall settings. There are several ways to do this:
    
**Method 1:**  Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box. Type `control firewall.cpl` and press Enter, on the left panel click ` Advanced settings"
**Method 2:** Go to the Start menu, type "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security," and select the result.

For both steps 1 and 2 we will add new outbound rules.

1.  In the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security window, click on "Outbound Rules" on the left, then on the right pane, click on "New Rule..." to create a new outbound rule. (Or right click on outbound rules > new rule".)

1.  
## Step 1 - Blocking the destination port (Teredo port 3544)

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.



Note: If you have another software that is performing network scans, then change the destination port to the port you see in the log as you set fit for your needs.

## Step 2 - `Blocking traffic to private networks`

In this section we will add firewall rules to block outgoing traffic to the  following [private networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) :

-   `10.0.0.0/8`
-   `172.16.0.0/12`
-   `192.168.0.0/16`
-   `100.64.0.0/10`
In a nutshell, these are not public IPs, but reserved for internal/private usage. If have an application that is misconfigured, it may try to connect to some of these. 
An exemple of a private network is the IP you visit to configure your router (usually starts with 192), or the internal IP at office for your printer (commonly it starts with 192 or 172).  Some examples of un-intentional abuse of these ports: You are developing an app (or using an app) that is designed for internal use in a company, and it connects to some locally hosted server on a private port. If you copy this app on your hetzner server for deployement it won't make sense to visit a private IP since it is no longer the same network at your office.

To block them:

Follow step 0 then 
1.  In the New Outbound Rule Wizard select the "Custom" radio button and click "Next."
2.  Leave program on "all programs" then click "next" and leave the protocol and port settings as the default and click "Next."
3. Under the "Which remote IP addresses does this rule apply to?" section, select the "These IP addresses" radio button.
4. Click on "Add..." to specify the IP address range or addresses you want to block.
5. In the "This IP address or subnet" field, enter the first of the IP address range you want to block. So in our case for private networks enter the first of the 4 ranges, so let's add	   `10.0.0.0/8` then press "ok"
6. repeat step 5 for the remaining ranges:
	-   `172.16.0.0/12`
	-   `192.168.0.0/16`
	-   `100.64.0.0/10`
After adding the 4 ranges, your settings will look like this:

7. Click "next"
8. Make sure the "Block the connection" radio button is selected, and click "Next."
9. Leave settings for "when does this rule apply" on defaults and click "Next"
10. Give your rule a name (mandatory) and, and  a description (optional). Click "Finish" to create the rule.

Now, the outbound rule should be in effect. Any outgoing traffic to the specified IP address ranges will be blocked by Windows Firewall and you won't get any abuse emails about if from your provider.

Finally...

### Step 2.1 - `<Summary of Step>`

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - `<Summary of Step>`

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - `Enabling IPV6 (Optional)`

As we explained above, Teredo is useful for tunnelling IPv6. The good news is, you can still use IPv6 without it if you have a server with Hetzner since all Hetzner servers do have native IPv6.

For more on this you may check:
https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/ip/ip-basics/

and the section **"IPv6 configuration**" from https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/windows-on-cloud/




## Bonus Step  - `<Summary of Step>`
-- @TODO here a step to find out what is using the port, the cmd command and process explorer
Yet more instructions.


## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.

If you have been brought here because of netscan abuse emails, and your server continues to have the issue, consider monitoring what software is the culprit with process explorer and netstat.
