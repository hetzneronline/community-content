## Introduction


This tutorial aims to cover some configurations to perform in your windows firewall to prevent network abuse. This tutorial covers two important things,  blocking teredo* ports from sending packets to the internet and blocking private networks. There are various reasons you may want to do this. In my case,  I got an email from the abuse team of my provider, regarding a server of mine performing big amount of netscans. The logs had a lot of event that looked like this

```
> time                protocol src_ip src_port          dest_ip dest_port
> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>     	[some destination ip 1]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>      [some destination ip 2]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>   	[some destination ip 3]  3544
> [DATE and time] UDP    [Your Server IP] 59300 =>    	[some destination ip 4]  3544
> [DATE and time] TCP    [Your Server IP] 59762 =>      10.0.0.138[a private ip] 10983
```

The source port here is 59300, which is normal and this port SHOULD NOT BE blocked as other services use it to. The port 3544 is the port used by Teredo to listen, so your server sends requests to other servers on their 3544 port.  Additionally you may notice Private IPs in the list. It is better to block them as well. So we are going to deal with the 2 possible culprits for network issues.

Teredo*: "Teredo is an IPv6 transition technology that provides address assignment and host-to-host automatic tunneling for unicast IPv6 traffic when IPv6/IPv4 hosts are located behind one or multiple IPv4 network address translators (NATs)." from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/teredo/portal#:~:text=Teredo%20is%20an%20IPv6%20transition,network%20address%20translators%20%28NATs%29.)
**Prerequisites**

- The steps are simple to follow, you only need to know how to login to an account with administrator priveleges.

## Step 1 - Blocking Teredo port 3544

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.

Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial.

It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.

Feel free to include screenshots, to show exactly what the user should be seeing. Please put screenshots in a separate "images" folder.

The amount of steps will depend entirely on how long/complicated the tutorial is.

## Step 2 - `Blocking private networks`

Quick introduction.

Start by...

Then...

Finally...

### Step 2.1 - `<Summary of Step>`

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - `<Summary of Step>`

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - `Enabling IPV6 (Optional)`

As we explained above, Teredo is useful for tunnelling IPv6. The good news is, you can still use IPv6 without it if you have a server with Hetzner since all Hetzner servers do have native IPv6.

For more on this you may check:
https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/ip/ip-basics/

and the section **"IPv6 configuration**" from https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/windows-on-cloud/




## Bonus Step  - `<Summary of Step>`
-- @TODO here a step to find out what is using the port, the cmd command and process explorer
Yet more instructions.


## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
