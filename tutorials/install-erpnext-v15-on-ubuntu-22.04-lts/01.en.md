This comprehensive tutorial guides developers and system administrators through the step-by-step process, ensuring a smooth deployment of the latest ERPNext version on the robust Ubuntu platform. Elevate your business management capabilities with ERPNext â€“ join us on the path to a streamlined and efficient ERP setup.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin the installation process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Hetzner Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) in the [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)

Operating System:
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Software Dependencies:
* Python 3.11+
*Node.js 20+
*MariaDB 10.3.x

User Privileges:
* A user account with sudo privileges on the Ubuntu system.
* [SSH key](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key)

Ensure that your system meets these prerequisites to ensure a successful installation of ERPNext version 15 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

**Example terminology**

Many tutorials will need to include example usernames, hostnames, domains, and IPs. To simplify this, all tutorials should use the same default examples, as outlined below.

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

Do **not** use actual IPs in your tutorial.
