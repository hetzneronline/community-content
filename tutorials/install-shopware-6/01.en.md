## Introduction

Shopware is a trendsetting ecommerce platform to power your online business. It offers a combination of beauty & brains needed to build and customize a fully responsive online store. In this tutorial, we will learn how to install and configure Shopware 6 with Nginx on Ubuntu 22.04.

**Prerequisites**

* Make sure you are logged in with a user with sudo access to the server.
  * It is not possible to follow this tutorial on a Hetzner managed server.
* A registered domain with the required records as follows:
  * A record with `example.com` and a reference to the server's IP address
  * A record with `www.example.com` and a reference to the server's IP address (optional)

**Note:** `example.com` is your domain address (for example hetzner.com)

## Step 1 - Installing Nginx, MySQL and PHP-FPM

Before we begin with the installation of packages, we will add the [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php) to install newer PHP versions:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

We can now install Nginx, MySQL and PHP-FPM with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install unzip nginx php8.3-fpm php8.3-mysql php8.3-curl php8.3-gd php8.3-xml php8.3-zip php8.3-opcache php8.3-mbstring php8.3-intl php8.3-cli mysql-server-8.0
```

To confirm the installation, press enter and then all related packages will be installed.

## Step 2 - Creating a database and user for the Shopware database

Shopware will need credentials to connect to the database. We will create a new MySQL user and a new MySQL Database. With the command `sudo mysql` we start a new mysql session. In this MySQL session we create a new database named `shopware` using the following query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopware;
```

Next we will create a new MySQL user `shopware` using the following query:

```sql
CREATE USER 'shopware'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my-strong-password-here';
```

As a last step we will need to give the new user privilege to access our new database using the follow query:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON shopware.* TO 'shopware'@'localhost';
```

We can end the mysql session by entering `exit`.

## Step 3 - Configuring PHP/PHP-FPM

To match the requirements of Shopware 6, we will need to adjust some `php.ini` settings. The `php.ini` used by PHP-FPM can be found under `/etc/php/8.3/fpm/php.ini`. We can open it with an editor like `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/8.3/fpm/php.ini
```

We then search with `CTRL` + `W` for `memory_limit =` and set the value from 128 to 512.

Next we will change the upload limits for files. Search again, this time for `post_max_size =` and `upload_max_filesize =` using `STRG` + `W` and replace the values with `32M`.

This will allow us to upload larger files to the media manager. We can save the file with `STRG` + `O` and leave the editor with `STRG` + `X`.

After configuring, we can restart the PHP-FPM server using the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
```

It should be also marked to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable php8.3-fpm
```

## Step 4 - Configuring Nginx

The default vhost configuration can be found under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`. We will edit it to add the Shopware vhost configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Replace the content with:

> Replace `example.com` with your own domain.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    # Handle / to index.php
    index index.php;

    # Our server name
    server_name example.com;

    # Should be equal to post_max_size
    client_max_body_size 32M;

    # Where the code is located
    root /var/www/html/public;

    location /recovery/update/ {
        location /recovery/update/assets {
        }
        if (!-e $request_filename){
            rewrite . /recovery/update/index.php last;
        }
    }

    # Forward any not found file to index.php. Allows to have beautiful urls like /homemade-products/
    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # Let php-fpm handle .php files
    location ~ ^/(index|shopware-installer\.phar)\.php(/|$) {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        include fastcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
        fastcgi_buffers 8 16k;
        fastcgi_buffer_size 32k;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 300s;
        client_body_buffer_size 128k;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
    }
}
```

Now we can restart nginx and mark it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

## Step 5 - Installing Shopware 6

After configuring MySQL, PHP and Nginx we start the installation of Shopware. We will install it to `/var/www/html`.

First we install the Composer package manager by downloading it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo wget https://getcomposer.org/download/latest-stable/composer.phar -O /usr/local/bin/composer
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer
```

After installing Composer, we switch to the `www-data` user to install Shopware using Composer.

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo -u www-data bash
cd /var/www/html
```

Remove default file in this folder:

```bash
rm index.nginx-debian.html
```

Download Shopware 6 :

```bash
composer create-project shopware/production .
```

---------

Now we can access the installation wizard using our domain. For example:

```http
https://example.com/
```

![Wizard Start Page](images/wizard.png)

In the Database Configuration we can use the configured credentials:

After finishing the wizard and the first run wizard, the Shop is ready for use.

![Administration](images/admin.png)

## Step 6 - Configuring background queue worker

In the default configuration, Shopware 6 will run a browser worker to consume all background tasks. This will block PHP-FPM processes for 30s. When multiple tabs / users are working at the same time in the administration, it will slow down page speed. To fix these issues, we will configure a background worker using systemd.

To disable the current browser worker, we will create a new file `config/packages/shopware.yaml`:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/config/packages/shopware.yaml
```

Then disable it with the following config:

```yaml
shopware:
    admin_worker:
        enable_admin_worker: false
```

To activate the config, we need to clear the cache:

```bash
sudo -u www-data php bin/console cache:clear
```

Now we can create a new systemd unit which interacts as worker. For that we have to create these two new files:

| File name                                             | Description                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/etc/systemd/system/shopware_consumer.service`       | Consumes messages from queue |
| `/etc/systemd/system/shopware_scheduled_task.service` | Runs scheduled tasks         |

* Add the first file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shopware_consumer.service
  ```
  Add the following unit there:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Shopware Consumer
  After=mysql.service
  
  [Service]
  Type=simple
  User=www-data
  Restart=always
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/bin/console messenger:consume --time-limit=60 --memory-limit=512M
  ```

<br>

* Now we set up the shopware scheduled tasks runner:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shopware_scheduled_task.service
  ```
  Add the following unit there:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Shopware Scheduled Task
  After=mysql.service
  
  [Service]
  Type=simple
  User=www-data
  Restart=always
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/bin/console scheduled-task:run --time-limit=60 --memory-limit=512M
  ```

The processes will have a time limit of 60s and memory limit of 512m. After reaching a limit it will stop and the unit will restart the process.

Now we can start the workers with following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start shopware_consumer
sudo systemctl start shopware_scheduled_task
sudo systemctl enable shopware_consumer
sudo systemctl enable shopware_scheduled_task
```

## Step 7 - Configuring Let's Encrypt

To configure Let's Encrypt for our new virtual host in Nginx, please follow the [Install and Secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-secure-nginx-lets-encrypt-debian-10) tutorial.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial you will have a shop running with Shopware 6. The next steps would be to start adding products and configuring payment providers. To login as admin, you can go to `example.com/admin`.
