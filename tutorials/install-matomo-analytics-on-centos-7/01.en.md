## Introduction

Matomo, formerly Piwik, is a free and open source web analytics application developed by a team of international developers, that runs on a PHP/MySQL webserver. It tracks online visits to one or more websites and displays reports on these visits for analysis.

**Prerequisites**

To run Matomo on your server, you need:

- Webserver such as Apache, Nginx, etc.

- PHP version 5.5.9 or greater

- MySQL version 5.5 or greater, or MariaDB

- (enabled by default) PHP extension pdo and pdo_mysql, or the mysqli extension.

According to the [Matomo Requirements](https://matomo.org/docs/requirements/) using PHP 7.x, MariaDB and PHP Extension such as "PHP GD Extension" is recommended.

## Step 1 - Installing LEMP Stack

As mentioned in the requirements section of the tutorial, a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB and PHP) is required to run Matomo on the server. We will start with installing Nginx web server:

```bash
yum install epel-release
yum install nginx
```

Start and enable Nginx on boot:

```bash
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
```

Install MariaDB database server using the following command:

```bash
yum install mariadb-server mariadb
```

After finish installation, start and enable MariaDB service:

```bash
systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb
```

Secure MariaDB with this command:

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

The prompt asks you for your current MYSQL root password. At this stage you won’t have one yet, so just leave it blank by hitting enter. When you are prompted to set a root password, just type `Y` and follow the instructions to set up your root password and make note of it.

Output:

```bash
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!
```

PHP version 7.x is not available in the default CentOS 7 repositories so we will use the Remi repository.

```bash
yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
yum install yum-utils
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72
```

Install PHP and the required PHP extensions using the following command:

```bash
yum install php php-mysql php-fpm php-mbstring php-xml php-gd
```

To configure the PHP processor, open the main php-fpm configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/php.ini
```

Find this line:

```bash
;cgi.fix_pathinfo=1
```

And replace with:

```bash
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
```

Save and quit.

Next, open the php-fpm configuration file `www.conf`:

```bash
vi /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
```

Find the line that specifies the `listen` parameter, and change it so it looks like the following:

```bash
listen = /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock
```

Next, find the lines that set the `listen.owner` and `listen.group` and uncomment them. They should look like this:

```bash
listen.owner = nginx
listen.group = nginx
```

Lastly, find the lines that set the `user` and `group` and change their values from "apache" to "nginx":

```bash
user = nginx
group = nginx
```

After you save and quit the `wwww.conf` file, enable and start the PHP-FPM service with:

```bash
systemctl enable php-fpm
systemctl start php-fpm
```

To configure Nginx to process PHP pages, edit `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` to:

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

```bash
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  server_domain_name_or_IP;
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

Replace the value of `server_domain_name_or_IP` with the appropriate domain name or IP address.

Save and quit, and restart Nginx:

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 2 - Installing Matomo

Matomo is not available in the official CentOS 7 repositories, so we will have to download Matomo from the [official website](https://matomo.org/download/) and extract the Matomo archive to a directory on the server by executing the following commands:

```bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo-latest.zip
unzip matomo-latest.zip
rm matomo-latest.zip -y
mv matomo/* .
rmdir matomo
```

Change ownership of the `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory to `nginx`:

```bash
chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

## Step 3 - Create a Database for Matomo

Log into MySQL with the root:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

This installation uses MariaDB as the backend of Matomo, so we need to create a MySQL database and user for the Matomo installation.

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE matomo_db;
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON matomo_db.* TO matomo_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR-MATOMO-MYSQL-PASSWORD';
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
MariaDB [(none)]> quit;
```

## Step 4 - Complete Matomo Web Installer Wizzard

Open web browser and access the Matomo Installation at `http://YOUR-IP`.
