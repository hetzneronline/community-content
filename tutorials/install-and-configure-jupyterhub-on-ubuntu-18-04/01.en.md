## Introduction

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a multi-user system for publishing Jupyter notebooks. It can be used in collaborative settings like a classroom, a corporate data analysis group or a scientific research group. JupyterHub manages muliple instances of the Jupyter notebook server and provides a single point of management.

There are two flavors for JupyterHub. One is based on a distributed set of servers managed by Kubernetes for scalability to a large number of users and machines. The simpler version is called [The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)](https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and can support up to 100 users on a single machine. This tutorial will cover the installation of the TLJH. 

**Prerequisites**

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you will need the following:
* A server running Ubuntu 18.04 with at least 768MB of RAM
* Ability to access the server via SSH with sudo permissions
* A public IP address where the server can be reached by the JupyterHub users

This tutorial was tested using a Ubuntu 18.04 install on a CX11 server on Hetzner Cloud. 

## Step 1 - Install the prerequisites

Start by using the terminal program of your choice to SSH into the server. Ensure that you have the installation prerequisites on the server by running:

```
sudo apt install python3 git curl gcc python3-dev
```

## Step 2 - Run the JupyterHub installer

Copy the text below and paste it into the terminal. Replace the \<admin-user-name> with the name of your admin user for JupyterHub. The admin user can be used after installation to configure the server and set up additional users. 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py | sudo -E python3 - --admin \<admin-user-name>
```

After you have copied the text and set the <admin-user-name>, press Enter to begin the install. The install will download files for the installation and then run scripts to perform the setup. This will typically take about 5-10 minutes and will return 'Done!' when the installation process is complete.

## Step 3 - Access the server

Using the IP address for the server, try to access JupyterHub using http://\<public-ip> from your web browser. You should see the JupyterHub login page.

Login using the \<admin-user-name> you set in step 2 using any password. The password you set here will be used for this account in the future so make sure you use a strong password and note it down (or better yet, store it in your password manager).

At this point, you have a working JupyterHub. 

## Step 4 - Install packages

The basic JupyterHub install only contains core Python libraries. To do real work, you will need to install additional packages. This is done with the `sudo -E pip install` command. 

As an example, we will install the pandas library. Starting with your logged in admin user, open a terminal in JupyterHub in your browser using the following menu:

![Image of opening terminal](images/terminal_menu.png) 

This terminal allows you to run commands in the JupyterHub environment. To install pandas, type the following into this terminal. 

```
sudo -E pip install pandas
```

This will load the pandas package into JupyterHub where it can be used in any notebook. If you already have a Python notebook running, you will need to restart the notebook kernel to see the new package. 

## Step 5 - Add users

Once you have a running install of JupyterHub, you can add additional users. This is done in the web browser using the <admin-user-name> login. To do this, open the control panel in JupyterHub:

![Control panel](images/control_panel.png)

From the Control Panel, select the Admin link. 

![Admin page](images/admin.png)

In the Admin Page, click the Add Users button and create additional users. If the users should have administrative priviliges, select the Admin checkbox.

![Add users](images/add_users.png)

After you click the Add Users button, the users are added to the JupyterHub. The first time they login, they will need to set their password for future access.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial you have installed JupyterHub, added some Python libraries and users so they can get started using Jupyter Notebooks. At this point, you should consider [enabling HTTPS](https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/admin/https.html#howto-admin-https). 

A nice feature of running JupyterHub on Hetzer Cloud is that you can upgrade your server to a larger instance to get more power when you need it. If you need even more performance, you can install JupyterHub on Kubernetes in Hetzer Cloud.
