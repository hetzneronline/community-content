## Step 6 - Automating Cleanup

Since GMAB doesn't automatically terminate expired instances, you can set up scheduled cleanup to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Setting up a Cron Job (Linux/macOS)

1. Open your crontab file:

```bash
crontab -e
```

2. Add a line to run the cleanup command regularly:

```
# Clean up expired instances every hour
0 * * * * gmab terminate expired -y
```

This will run every hour on the hour. For less frequent cleanup:

```
# Run daily at midnight
0 0 * * * gmab terminate expired -y
```

### Using Windows Task Scheduler

On Windows, you can use Task Scheduler:

1. Create a batch file (e.g., `gmab-cleanup.bat`) with the following content:

```bat
@echo off
gmab terminate expired -y
```

2. Open Task Scheduler and create a new basic task
3. Set the task to run on a schedule (e.g., daily or hourly)
4. Point the action to your batch file

## Step 7 - Practical Use Case Examples

Here are some practical examples of using GMAB with Hetzner Cloud.

### Example 1: Quick Security Testing

Need to run a security scan from an external IP?

```bash
# Create a box with 30 minute lifetime
gmab spawn -p hetzner -t 30

# SSH into the box
ssh root@<ip-address>

# Run your security tools
# ...

# When done, terminate the instance
gmab terminate <instance-id>
```

### Example 2: Region-Specific Testing

Test how your website appears from different regions:

```bash
# Create instances in different regions
gmab spawn -p hetzner -r nbg1 -t 60
gmab spawn -p hetzner -r hel1 -t 60
gmab spawn -p hetzner -r ash -t 60

# Run your tests from each instance
# ...

# Clean up when finished
gmab terminate all -p hetzner -y
```

### Example 3: Running Cron Jobs or Scheduled Tasks

Use GMAB to run regular jobs using cron (Linux) or scheduled tasks (Windows) without keeping your local machine turned on:

```bash
# Create a box with longer lifetime
gmab spawn -p hetzner -t 1440  # 24 hours

# Connect to the instance
ssh root@<ip-address>

# Set up a cron job (Linux)
# Example: crontab -e
# 0 */4 * * * /path/to/script.sh

# Or set up a scheduled task on Windows Server
# ...

# Manually terminate when tasks are complete
gmab terminate <instance-id>
```
