## Introduction

Sometimes you need a quick cloud server for a temporary task - maybe for testing from a different IP address, running a short computational job, or setting up a temporary development environment. Manually creating and managing these temporary servers through cloud provider UIs can become tedious and error-prone.

This is where [GMAB (Give Me A Box)](https://github.com/superfishlu/gmab) comes in. GMAB is a command-line tool that makes it easy to spawn, manage, and clean up temporary cloud instances across multiple providers, including Hetzner Cloud. The tool is particularly useful for:

- Bug bounty hunting from different IP addresses
- Web scraping or testing from various regions
- Running temporary workloads without manual cleanup
- Development environments that don't need to persist
- Quick access to computational resources in different geographic locations

In this tutorial, we'll focus on using GMAB with Hetzner Cloud, covering everything from installation and configuration to daily usage patterns.

**Prerequisites**

Before getting started with GMAB, you'll need:

* Local machine:
  * [Python 3.7 or higher installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Pip (Python package manager)
  * An [SSH key pair](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) (ed25519 recommended)

<br>

* A Hetzner Cloud account

## Step 1 - Installing GMAB

GMAB can be installed directly from PyPI (Python Package Index) using pip. Open your terminal and run one of the following commands:

For a system-wide installation:

```bash
pip install gmab
```

For a user-specific installation (without admin privileges):

```bash
pip install --user gmab
```

After installation, verify that GMAB installed correctly:

```bash
gmab --help
```

You should see the help menu displaying the available commands and options.

## Step 2 - Setting Up Hetzner Cloud Project and API Token

Before configuring GMAB, you need to set up Hetzner Cloud appropriately by creating a dedicated project and generating an API token.

### Creating a Dedicated Project

1. Log in to your Hetzner Cloud Console at [console.hetzner.cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)

2. Click the **+ New project** button:
   
   ![Hetzner Cloud - Project EN](images/project1-en.png)

3. Name your project **gmab** (or another name of your choice)
   
   ![Hetzner Cloud - Project EN](images/project2-en.png)

4. Click **Add project** to create and switch to the new project.

### Generating an API Token

Now that you have a project, you can generate the API token as explained in the official documentation: [Generating an API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token)

## Step 3 - Configuring GMAB

Now that you have your Hetzner Cloud project and API token, you can configure GMAB for use with Hetzner Cloud.

### Initial Configuration

Run the configuration wizard:

```bash
gmab configure
```

The tool will guide you through an interactive configuration process. When prompted to configure Hetzner, select "y" and enter your API token:

```shellsession
$ gmab configure
Using config directory: /home/user/.config/gmab

Configuring general settings:
SSH public key path [~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub]: 
Default instance lifetime (minutes) [60]: 
Default provider (linode, aws, hetzner) [linode]: hetzner

Do you want to configure linode? [Y/n]: n

Do you want to configure aws? [Y/n]: n

Do you want to configure hetzner? [Y/n]: y

Configuring hetzner provider:
API Key: your-hetzner-api-token-here
Default region [nbg1]: 
Default image [ubuntu-22.04]: ubuntu-24.04
Default instance type [cpx11]: 

Configuration completed successfully!
```

### Understanding Configuration Options

During configuration, you'll have several options to customize:

| Option                | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| SSH Key Path          | This is the path to your public SSH key that will be uploaded to each new instance, allowing you to connect to it securely. The default location is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, but you can specify a different key if needed. |
| Default Lifetime      | The default lifetime in minutes before instances are considered "expired." The default is 60 minutes, but you can set this higher or lower based on your typical usage patterns. |
| Default Region        | Hetzner Cloud has several regions available (see [this list](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations#what-locations-are-there)). If you frequently work with a particular region, set it as your default. |
| Default Instance Type | Hetzner offers various instance types (see [this list](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/#pricing)). |

## Step 4 - Creating Your First Instance

Now that GMAB is configured, let's create your first Hetzner Cloud instance.

### Basic Instance Creation

To spawn a Hetzner Cloud instance using your default settings:

```bash
gmab spawn
```

If Hetzner is not your default provider, specify it with the `-p` flag:

```bash
gmab spawn -p hetzner
```

You'll see output similar to this:

```shellsession
Spawned 'hetzner' instance:
  ID: 12345678
  Label: gmab-abc123def456
  IP: 192.168.1.100
  Connect via: ssh root@192.168.1.100
```

### Customizing Your Instance

GMAB allows you to override defaults when spawning an instance:

```bash
# Specify a different region
gmab spawn -p hetzner -r hel1

# Specify a different image
gmab spawn -p hetzner -i ubuntu-24.04

# Specify instance lifetime (in minutes)
gmab spawn -p hetzner -t 120  # 2 hour lifetime

# Combine options
gmab spawn -p hetzner -r fsn1 -i debian-12 -t 180
```

### Connecting to Your Instance

Once the instance is running, connect to it using SSH:

```bash
ssh root@<ip_address>
```

Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address shown in the spawn output.

## Step 5 - Managing Your Instances

GMAB provides commands to help you manage your temporary instances.

### Listing All Instances

To view all your active Hetzner instances:

```bash
gmab list -p hetzner
```

Example output:

```shell
Provider    Instance ID     Label                IP Address       Status              Region    Image              Time Left
=============================================================================================================
hetzner     12345678        gmab-abc123def456    192.168.1.100    running             nbg1       ubuntu-24.04      45m
hetzner     98765432        gmab-ghi789jkl012    10.0.0.100       running             hel1       ubuntu-24.04      15m
hetzner     56781234        gmab-mno345pqr678    10.0.2.200       running (expired)   fsn1       debian-12         expired
```

The `Time Left` column shows how much time remains before the instance is considered expired.

### Understanding the Expiration Mechanism

A key feature of GMAB is its expiration mechanism. Here's how it works:

1. When you spawn an instance, you specify a lifetime in minutes (default is 60)
2. GMAB tracks this lifetime and marks instances as "expired" once the time is up
3. **Important: GMAB does NOT automatically delete expired instances**
4. You must explicitly run a command to delete expired instances

This design gives you control over when instances are actually deleted, preventing unexpected disruptions while you're still using them.

### Deleting Instances

To delete a specific instance:

```bash
gmab terminate 12345678  # Using Instance ID
```

Or:

```bash
gmab terminate gmab-abc123def456  # Using Label
```

To delete multiple instances at once:

```bash
gmab terminate 12345678 98765432
```

#### Deleting All Instances

To delete all your Hetzner instances:

```bash
gmab terminate all -p hetzner
```

You'll be prompted for confirmation:

```shellsession
The following instances will be terminated:
- 12345678 (hetzner: gmab-abc123def456)
- 98765432 (hetzner: gmab-ghi789jkl012)
- 56781234 (hetzner: gmab-mno345pqr678)
Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: 
```

#### Deleting Expired Instances

The most common cleanup task is deleting expired instances:

```bash
gmab terminate expired -p hetzner
```

Again, you'll see a confirmation prompt:

```shellsession
The following expired instances will be terminated:
- 56781234 (hetzner: gmab-mno345pqr678)
Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: 
```

#### Using the -y Flag for Automated Cleanup

For scripts or automated tasks, you can use the `-y` flag to bypass confirmation prompts:

```bash
gmab terminate expired -p hetzner -y
```

This is particularly useful for scheduled cleanup jobs, as we'll see in the next section.

## Step 6 - Automating Cleanup

Since GMAB doesn't automatically delete expired instances, you can set up scheduled cleanup to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Setting up a Cron Job (Linux/macOS)

1. Open your crontab file:
   
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a line to run the cleanup command regularly:
   
   ```shellsession
   # Clean up expired instances every hour
   0 * * * * gmab terminate expired -y
   ```
   
   This will run every hour on the hour. For less frequent cleanup:
   
   ```shellsession
   # Run daily at midnight
   0 0 * * * gmab terminate expired -y
   ```

### Using Windows Task Scheduler

On Windows, you can use Task Scheduler:

1. Create a batch file (e.g., `gmab-cleanup.bat`) with the following content:
   
   ```bat
   @echo off
   gmab terminate expired -y
   ```

2. Open Task Scheduler and create a new basic task
3. Set the task to run on a schedule (e.g., daily or hourly)
4. Point the action to your batch file

## Step 7 - Practical Use Case Examples

Here are some practical examples of using GMAB with Hetzner Cloud.

* **Example 1:** Quick Security Testing
  
  Need to run a security scan from an external IP?
  
  ```bash
  # Create a box with 30 minute lifetime
  gmab spawn -p hetzner -t 30
  
  # SSH into the box
  ssh root@<ip-address>
  
  # Run your security tools
  # ...
  
  # When done, delete the instance
  gmab terminate <instance-id>
  ```

<br>

* **Example 2:** Region-Specific Testing
  
  Test how your website appears from different regions:
  
  ```bash
  # Create instances in different regions
  gmab spawn -p hetzner -r nbg1 -t 60
  gmab spawn -p hetzner -r hel1 -t 60
  gmab spawn -p hetzner -r ash -t 60
  
  # Run your tests from each instance
  # ...
  
  # Clean up when finished
  gmab terminate all -p hetzner -y
  ```

<br>

* **Example 3:** Running Cron Jobs or Scheduled Tasks
  
  Use GMAB to run regular jobs using cron (Linux) or scheduled tasks (Windows) without keeping your local machine turned on:
  
  ```bash
  # Create a box with longer lifetime
  gmab spawn -p hetzner -t 1440  # 24 hours
  
  # Connect to the instance
  ssh root@<ip-address>
  
  # Set up a cron job (Linux)
  # Example: crontab -e
  # 0 */4 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  
  # Or set up a scheduled task on Windows Server
  # ...
  
  # Manually delete when tasks are complete
  gmab terminate <instance-id>
  ```
