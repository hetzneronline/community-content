## Introduction

Sometimes you need a quick cloud server for a temporary task - maybe for testing from a different IP address, running a short computational job, or setting up a temporary development environment. Manually creating and managing these temporary servers through cloud provider UIs can become tedious and error-prone.

This is where GMAB (Give Me A Box) comes in. GMAB is a command-line tool that makes it easy to spawn, manage, and clean up temporary cloud instances across multiple providers, including Hetzner Cloud. The tool is particularly useful for:

- Bug bounty hunting from different IP addresses
- Web scraping or testing from various regions
- Running temporary workloads without manual cleanup
- Development environments that don't need to persist
- Quick access to computational resources in different geographic locations

In this tutorial, we'll focus on using GMAB with Hetzner Cloud, covering everything from installation and configuration to daily usage patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with GMAB, you'll need:

* A Hetzner Cloud account
* Python 3.7 or higher installed on your local machine
* Pip (Python package manager)
* An SSH key pair (ed25519 recommended)

## Step 1 - Installing GMAB

GMAB can be installed directly from PyPI (Python Package Index) using pip. Open your terminal and run one of the following commands:

For a system-wide installation:

```bash
pip install gmab
```

For a user-specific installation (without admin privileges):

```bash
pip install --user gmab
```

After installation, verify that GMAB installed correctly:

```bash
gmab --help
```

You should see the help menu displaying the available commands and options.
