## Step 3 - Configuring GMAB

Now that you have your Hetzner Cloud project and API token, you can configure GMAB for use with Hetzner Cloud.

### Initial Configuration

Run the configuration wizard:

```bash
gmab configure
```

The tool will guide you through an interactive configuration process. When prompted to configure Hetzner, select "y" and enter your API token:

```
$ gmab configure
Using config directory: /home/user/.config/gmab

Configuring general settings:
SSH public key path [~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub]: 
Default instance lifetime (minutes) [60]: 
Default provider (linode, aws, hetzner) [linode]: hetzner

Do you want to configure linode? [Y/n]: n

Configuration completed successfully!
```

### Understanding Configuration Options

During configuration, you'll have several options to customize:

#### SSH Key Path
This is the path to your public SSH key that will be uploaded to each new instance, allowing you to connect to it securely. The default location is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, but you can specify a different key if needed.

#### Default Lifetime
The default lifetime in minutes before instances are considered "expired." The default is 60 minutes, but you can set this higher or lower based on your typical usage patterns.

#### Default Region
Hetzner Cloud has several regions available:

- `nbg1` - Nuremberg, Germany
- `fsn1` - Falkenstein, Germany
- `hel1` - Helsinki, Finland
- `ash` - Ashburn, Virginia, USA

If you frequently work with a particular region, set it as your default.

#### Default Instance Type
Hetzner offers various instance types. Some common ones include:

- `cpx11` - 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM (default in GMAB)
- `cpx21` - 3 vCPU, 4 GB RAM
- `cpx31` - 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM
- `cx11` - 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM
- `cx21` - 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM
