## Introduction

Let's Encrypt is a new Certificate Authority (CA) that provides an easy way to obtain and install free TLS/SSL certificates, thereby enabling encrypted HTTPS on web servers. It simplifies the process by providing a software client, Certbot, that attempts to automate most (if not all) of the required steps. Currently, the entire process of obtaining and installing a certificate is fully automated on both Apache and Nginx web servers.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the `certbot` Let's Encrypt client to obtain a free SSL certificate and use it with Nginx on Ubuntu 18.04. We will also show you how to automatically renew your SSL certificate.

**Prerequisites**

To install Nginx and setup Let's Encrypt using certbot, you need:

- An Ubuntu 18.04 server with a `sudo` user.

- A DNS A Record that points your domain to the public IP address of your server.

Our setup will use **example.com** and **www.example.com** as the domain names, so both DNS records are required.

## Step 1 - Install Nginx

Nginx is available in the default Ubuntu 18.04 repository, it is possible to install it from these repositories using the apt packaging system.

```bash
apt install nginx
```

Once it is installed, enable Nginx start on boot and run it:

```bash
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
```

In order to check if Nginx is running, you can visit your IP address via the browser.

Open in a web browser:

```bash
http://server_domain_name_or_IP/
```

## Step 2 - Configure Nginx

Certbot can automatically configure SSL for Nginx, but it needs to be able to find the correct `server` block in your config. It does this by looking for a `server_name `directive that matches the domain you're requesting a certificate for. If you're starting out with a fresh Nginx install, you can update the default config file:

Create the directory for **example.com** as follows, using the `-p` flag to create any necessary parent directories:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
```

Next, assign ownership of the directory with the `$USER` environment variable:

```bash
chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```

The permissions of your web roots should be correct if you haven't modified your `umask` value, but you can make sure by typing:

```bash
chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com
```

Next, create a sample `index.html` page using `vi` or your favorite editor:

```bash
vi /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
```

Inside, add the following sample HTML:

```bash
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to Example.com!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success!  The example.com server block is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Save and close the file when you are finished.

In order for Nginx to serve this content, it's necessary to create a server block with the correct directives. Instead of modifying the default configuration file directly, let’s make a new one at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`:

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
```

Paste in the following configuration block, which is similar to the default, but updated for our new directory and domain name:

```bash
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/example.com/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

Notice that we’ve updated the `root` configuration to our new directory, and the `server_name` to our domain name.

Next, let's enable the file by creating a link from it to the `sites-enabled` directory, which Nginx reads from during startup:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Save the file and quit your editor. Verify the syntax of your configuration edits with:

```bash
nginx -t
```

If that runs with no errors, reload Nginx to load the new configuration:

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

Certbot will now be able to find the correct `server` block and update it. 

## Step 3 - Install Certbot

The first step to using Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate is to install the certbot software on your server.

You can obtain the certbot-nginx package by typing:

```bash
apt install python-certbot-nginx
```

The certbot Let's Encrypt client is now installed and ready to use.

## Step 4 - Obtaining a Certificate

Certbot provides a variety of ways to obtain SSL certificates, through various plugins. The Nginx plugin will take care of reconfiguring Nginx and reloading the config whenever necessary:

```bash
certbot --nginx --rsa-key-size 4096 -d example.com -d www.example.com
```

This runs `certbot` with the `--nginx` plugin, using `-d` to specify the names we'd like the certificate to be valid for.

If this is your first time running `certbot`, you will be prompted to enter an email address and agree to the terms of service. After doing so, `certbot` will communicate with the Let's Encrypt server, then run a challenge to verify that you control the domain you're requesting a certificate for.

If that's successful, `certbot` will ask how you'd like to configure your HTTPS settings:

Sample Output:

```bash
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
change by editing your web server's configuration.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
```

Select your choice then hit **ENTER**. The configuration will be updated, and Nginx will reload to pick up the new settings. `certbot` will wrap up with a message telling you the process was successful and where your certificates are stored:

```bash
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2019-10-26. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

Your certificates are downloaded, installed, and loaded. Try reloading your website using `https://` and notice your browser's security indicator. It should represent that the site is properly secured, usually with a green lock icon.

## Step 5 - Setting Up Auto Renewal

Let's Encrypt's certificates are only valid for ninety days. This is to encourage users to automate their certificate renewal process. The `certbot` package we installed takes care of this for us by adding a renew script to `/etc/cron.d`. This script runs twice a day and will automatically renew any certificate that's within thirty days of expiration.

To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
```

If you see no errors, you're all set. When necessary, Certbot will renew your certificates and reload Nginx to pick up the changes. If the automated renewal process ever fails, Let’s Encrypt will send a message to the email you specified, warning you when your certificate is about to expire.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you have learned how to secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt SSL on Ubuntu 18.04 with certbot and setup automatic certificate renewal.
