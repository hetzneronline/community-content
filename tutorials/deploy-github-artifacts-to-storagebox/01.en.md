<summary>Advantages</summary>

Using GitHub Actions workflow to store artifacts built on GitHub on your server or Storage Box offers several advantages:

* **Automation**: Automating the process of building and deploying artifacts streamlines your development workflow. With GitHub Actions, you can trigger the deployment automatically whenever changes are pushed to your repository. This reduces manual intervention and potential human errors.

* **Consistency**: Automated deployments ensure consistency in the artifacts you store on your server or Storage Box. Every time you push changes to your repository, GitHub Actions will build and deploy the latest version, eliminating the risk of deploying outdated or incorrect files.

* **Version Control**: GitHub provides version control for your code and, by extension, your artifacts. Each deployment is associated with a specific commit or branch, making it easy to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

* **Security**: By using GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like SSH keys and server / Storage Box credentials, you can maintain a higher level of security. These secrets are encrypted and not exposed in your repository's history.

* **Scalability**: GitHub Actions can handle a variety of deployment scenarios, from simple artifact uploads to complex deployment pipelines. As your project grows, you can expand and customize your workflow to accommodate evolving needs.

* **Flexibility**: This approach gives you the flexibility to deploy various types of artifacts, including websites, applications, data files, and more. You can tailor the GitHub Actions workflow to meet your specific deployment requirements.

* **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can collaborate on a project and use the same automated deployment process. This ensures that everyone is working with the latest version of the artifacts.

* **Monitoring and Logging**: GitHub Actions provides monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing you to track the progress of deployments, identify any issues, and receive notifications in case of failures.

**Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the deployment process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **GitHub Repository**: You should have a GitHub repository containing the artifact you want to deploy.

2. **Server or Hetzner Storage Box**: If you're using a Storage Box, ensure the necessary SSH access credentials & external connectivity are enabled.

3. **SSH Client**: You need to have an SSH client installed on your local machine. If you're using Linux or macOS, you can use the built-in SSH client. On Windows, you can use PuTTY or another SSH client of your choice.

4. **SSH key**: You can create either an ED25519 key or an RSA key. On Linux, you can use the `ssh-keygen` comand (e.g. `ssh-keygen -f <any-name> -t ed25519`). For more information, see [Setting up an SSH key](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key). On Windows, you can use [PuTTYgen](https://www.puttygen.com/).  

**Example terminology**

* **Remote server**: `<203.0.113.1>`<br>
  » Example user: `holu`<br><br>

* **Hetzner Storage Box**: `uXXXXX.your-storagebox.de`<br>
  » Example user: `xxxxx-sub2`<br><br>

* **SSH key pair**<br>
  » Private key: `<key-name>`<br>
  » Public key: `<key-name>.pub`

## Step 1 - Setting up the SSH key

GitHub needs an SSH key to access the server or Storage Box. This tutorial assumes that you created a new SSH key pair on your local machine. You have to save the **private** key on GitHub, and the **public** key on the server or Storage Box.

It is recommended to use a new SSH key pair that is only used for this deployment and for nothing else.

### Step 1.1 - Saving the public key on the server or Storage Box

#### Server

On your local machine, run:
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<key-name>.pub holu@<203.0.113.1>
```

You can also add the key manually. Copy the public key, connect to the server, and add the key in this file: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

----------------

#### Storage Box

It is highly recommended to create a sub account restricted to a base folder within the Storage Box. 
When a sub account is created, a username & password are shared by Hetzner (in an ephemeral way). You can connect to the Storage Box base directory with those credentials and setup the public key. 

Make sure the SSH support setting for your Storage Box is enabled.

* **Storage Box mounted on a server**<br>
  If you have mounted the Storage Box on a server, you can switch to the base directory on that Storage Box & setup these credentials directly over there, no need of using `scp` or `rsync`.

* **Storage Box unmounted**<br>
  If you are using Storage Box in an unmounted way, you can use the commands below. 

On your local machine, run:
```bash
ssh -p 23 xxxxx-sub2@uXXXXX.your-storagebox.de mkdir .ssh
scp -p 23  -r ~/.ssh/<key-name>.pub xxxxx-sub2@xxxxx.your-storagebox.de:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
> **Note:** Hetzner Storage Boxes only accept SSH connections on port 23. SSH defaults to port 22, so you have to specify port 23 while connecting.

### Step 1.2 - Saving the private key on GitHub

To securely store the credentials and SSH key to your server or Hetzner Storage Box, you should use GitHub Repository Secrets.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" » "Actions"
4. Click the "New repository secret" button.

Create three secrets:

| Example name        | Secret                                         | 
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ARTIFACT_SSH_KEY`  | Add your SSH private key                       |
| `ARTIFACT_USERNAME` | Add your username on the server or Storage Box |
| `ARTIFACT_HOST`     | Add the hostname of your server or Storage Box |

The name will be shown as plain text. The secret will be encrypted.

## Step 2 - GitHub Actions

Now that the SSH key and credentials are set up, you can get started with the deployment.

In your repository, create the directory `.github/workflows`. In this directory, add a new YAML file (e.g. `deploy-artifact.yml`) with the content below.

> Replace the following as needed:
> 
> | Example name                              | Secret                              | 
> | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
> | `ARTIFACT_SSH_KEY`<br>`ARTIFACT_HOST`<br>`ARTIFACT_USERNAME` | If you used different names, replace the names of the secrets |
> | `-p 22`                                   | The default SSH port is 22. If you have a Storage Box, replace "22" with port "23". |
> | `./your-artifact.ext`                     | Make sure to use the actual name of your artifact and the correct path in your GitHub Repo |
> | `~/path/to/destination/your-artifact.ext` | Change the path to a path that exists on your server or Storage Box |
> 
> In the example below, I'm using `scp`. You could also use `rsync` instead. Both binaries are available on ubuntu-latest image.

```yaml
#Sample CD file
name: Deploy to server or Storage Box
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up SSH key
        run: |
          env
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.ARTIFACT_SSH_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
          ssh-keyscan -p 22 -t ed25519 ${{ secrets.ARTIFACT_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Deploy to server or Storage Box
        run: |
          rsync -azP -e "ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 22" ./your-artifact.ext ${{ secrets.ARTIFACT_USERNAME }}@${{ secrets.ARTIFACT_HOST }}:~/path/to/destination/your-artifact.ext

```

## Step 3 - Trigger the Workflow

Push your changes to your GitHub repository. This will automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. It will build and deploy your artifact to your server or Storage Box whenever there is a push.
