## Introduction

Using this article, you can install and configure your VestaCP control panel on a dedicated server or VPS.

* Web Server - Apache
* FTP client - proftpd
* Email server - Exim + dovecot + spamassassin + clamav
* DNS Server - Bind
* Firewall - Iptables
* Database - mysql

**Prerequisites**

* You need a RHEL / CentOS, Debian or Ubuntu operating system on your dedicated server or VPS server.
* Set a hostname for your server and DNS will point to that server's IP address.
* A test email (admin@test.com) and a password (Test@123) are used during the installation process. You use a real email and password.

## Step 1 - Installing the VestaCP control panel

[Connect to the server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/connecting-to-the-server) via SSH. If you can't do it via the CLI, you can just use Putty software.

```console
cd /usr/local/src/
```

```console
wget -c https://vestacp.com/pub/vst-install.sh
```

```console
sh vst-install.sh --nginx yes --apache yes --phpfpm no --named yes --remi no --vsftpd no --proftpd yes --iptables yes --fail2ban no --quota yes --exim yes --dovecot yes --spamassassin yes --clamav yes --softaculous no --mysql yes --postgresql no --hostname hostname.com --email admin@test.com --password Test@123
```

## Step 2 - Log in to the admin panel

Depending on the server's hardware power and network speed, the installation may take 10-20 minutes, as the installation script downloads and installs many software packages from repositories.
After completing the instructions, you can see the login information in the control panel.


You may need to connect to port 8083 using https and the username and password provided on the installation page.

I have received the following connection data to my server:

https://142.132.xxx.xxx:8083
Username: admin
Password: test@123

## Step 3 - It may be necessary: Delete VestaCP

The VestaCP control panel is easy to clean. You can run the following commands:

```console
systemctl stop vesta
```

```console
yum remove vesta*
```

```console
rm -rf /usr/local/vesta
```

Don't forget to delete the admin data too. If you want to install another control panel, be sure to restart the operating system.

## Conclusion

VestaCP is not a professional hosting control panel. It does not have many features required for hosting.

But you can use it for personal site. Because this control panel is free, it can be a good option.
