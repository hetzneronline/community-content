## Introduction

# Setup Tailscale on Hetzner Cloud

When I started using Hetzner Cloud, I needed a quick and secure way to connect my server with my laptop and home devices. I didnâ€™t want to mess with VPNs or firewall rules, so I used **Tailscale**. It sets up a private network in minutes and just works.

---

## Step 1. Create a Server on Hetzner

- Log in or Signup to [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud).
- Create a new **Ubuntu server** (a small instance with 2 CPU cores is fine â€” Intel, AMD, or Ampere).
- Add your SSH key or set a root password.

---

## Step 2. Update the Server

Connect to your server via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

Update the system:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 3. Install Tailscale

Run the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

---

## Step 4. Start Tailscale

Start Tailscale with:

```bash
tailscale up
```

It will give you a login link. Open the link in your browser and log in with your Tailscale account (Google, GitHub, etc.).

---

## Step 5. Verify

Now the server is part of your **Tailscale network**.

- You can see it in the [Tailscale admin panel](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).
- Use the **Tailscale IP** to connect securely from anywhere.
- No need to open ports or configure firewalls. ðŸŽ‰

---

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it! With just a few commands, Tailscale is up and running on your Hetzner Cloud server. It gives you a fast, secure way to connect without messing with firewalls or VPN setupsâ€”perfect for safe access from anywhere.
