## Introduction

Recently I got an email from the network department of my provider, letting me know that they had indications that one of my servers was performing netscans on private networks. Certainly I had not initiated any netscan manually. Moreover I don't have lots of things installed on my server, only a few docker containers. So, where was the problem? And more importantly, how to fix it?

After switching off a couple of containers, the problem went away. I then examined how these containers are configured, and found one that starts with the option `--net=host`. Most probably this one was the culprit. By default docker containers don't have access to the network stack of the host, so they cannot launch a netscan on the private network where the host is located. But if they are started with `--net=host` their network is the same as that of the host.

Needless to say that I removed it. However the advice from the network team was to harden the firewall of the server in order to block any outgoing communications to their private networks. In this tutorial I show how I did it. My server is ubuntu-18.04 but I am sure that the same steps can be applied easily to other distros too.

## Step 1 - Make sure that ufw is installed

For managing the firewall of the server I use `ufw` (uncomplicated firewall).

First make sure that it is installed:

```bash
apt install ufw
```

Then configure it properly by allowing the ports of SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, etc. and enable it:

```bash
ufw allow 22
ufw allow 80
ufw allow 443

ufw enable

ufw status
```

## Step 2 - Block any communications to private networks

The [private networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) are:

- `10.0.0.0/8`
- `172.16.0.0/12`
- `192.168.0.0/16`
- `100.64.0.0/10`

It is quite easy to block outgoing communications to them with `ufw`:

```bash
ufw deny out from any to 10.0.0.0/8
ufw deny out from any to 172.16.0.0/12
ufw deny out from any to 192.168.0.0/16
ufw deny out from any to 100.64.0.0/10
ufw deny out from any to 198.18.0.0/15
ufw deny out from any to 169.254.0.0/16
```

Check the status of the firewall with `ufw status` and you will see something like this:

```console
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
[ . . . . . . . . . . ]

10.0.0.0/8                 DENY OUT    Anywhere
172.16.0.0/12              DENY OUT    Anywhere
100.64.0.0/10              DENY OUT    Anywhere
192.168.0.0/16             DENY OUT    Anywhere
```

You may also check with `iptables-save`, and you should see something like this:

```console
*filter

:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]

:ufw-before-output - [0:0]

:ufw-user-output - [0:0]

-A OUTPUT -j ufw-before-output

-A ufw-before-output -j ufw-user-output

-A ufw-user-output -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
-A ufw-user-output -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j DROP
-A ufw-user-output -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A ufw-user-output -d 100.64.0.0/10 -j DROP
```

You can test it with `ping`, for example `ping 172.16.5.204`, and you should get something like this:

```console
PING 172.16.5.204 (172.16.5.204) 56(84) bytes of data.
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
^C
--- 172.16.5.204 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3053ms
```

## Step 3 - Unblock (optional)

If for some reason you need to unblock one of these private networks, you can do it by deleting the corresponding ufw rule, like this:

```bash
ufw status numbered
ufw delete <rule-number>
```

## Conclusion

Communication from your server to private networks is not allowed on many providers. Blocking these communications with a firewall is important
especially if you don't have full control over what you install on your server. Doing it with ufw is very easy.
