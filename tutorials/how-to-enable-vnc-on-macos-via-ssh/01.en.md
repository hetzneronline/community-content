## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to activate the screen transfer (VNC) on MacOS with little effort if you only have SSH access.

**Prerequisites**

To do the tutorial correctly you need a server/computer with MacOS with the latest version installed.

Then connect to the server via SSH.

## Step 1 - Set privileges

```code
$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers -privs -all```

```

```
Starting...
Setting allow all users to YES.
Setting all users privileges to 1073742079.
Done.
```

## Step 2 - Allow VNC clients

```code
$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes 
```

```
Starting...
Set the client options.
Done.
```

## Step 3 - Set VNC password

```code
$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw supersecret
```

Note: replace `supersecret` with your own password.

```
Starting...
Set the client options.
Done.
```

## Step 4 - Restart service

```code
$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent -console
```

```
Starting...
Stopped ARD Agent.
Stopped VNC Privilege Proxy
Stopped RFB Register MDNS
Done.
```

## Step 5 - Activate ARD (Optional)

If no ARD services have been activated on the machine before, it is also necessary to run the following command:

```code
$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate
```

```
Starting...
Activated Remote Management.
Done.
```

## Conclusion

Now you have successfully enabled screen transfer on your MacOS server. You can now connect to the server using any VNC program.
