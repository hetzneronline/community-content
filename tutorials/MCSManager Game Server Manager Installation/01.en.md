## Introduction
MCSManager is a free, open-source game server hosting control panel. It consists of two main components: the Panel and the Daemon.

- **Panel:** The Panel is a web-based interface that allows you to manage all your game servers and instances from a single dashboard. You use the Panel to create, configure, monitor, and control your game servers.
- **Daemon:** The Daemon is a backend service that runs on each server (physical or virtual) where you want to host game instances. The Daemon communicates with the Panel and performs the actual management tasks, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring game servers.

MCSManager is designed for easy management of Minecraft, DayZ, Arma Reforger, Rust, and other Steam game servers. If you have multiple physical or virtual servers, MCSManager allows you to manage them all together with a single web interface.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 16.20.2 or above. You can check your version with `node -v`.
- x86_64 architecture (most modern servers).
- Windows Server 2012-2025 or most Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.).
- Recommended: Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, or Windows Server 2022.
- Ports: 23333 (Panel), 24444 (Daemon) must be open for TCP/UDP traffic.

## Linux Installation

### Step 1: Connect to Your Server
Log in to your server using SSH as root or a user with sudo privileges. For example:
```bash
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

### Step 2: Update Your System Packages
Update your package lists and upgrade installed packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 3: Verify or Install Node.js
Check if Node.js is installed:
```bash
node -v
```
If not installed, install it with:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Step 4: Download and Install MCSManager
Run the official installation script:
```bash
wget -qO- https://script.mcsmanager.com/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

### Step 5: Start the MCSManager Panel and Daemon Services
Start both the Panel and Daemon services:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mcsm-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start mcsm-web.service
```

**If this server is only for the Daemon (remote Daemon):**
Disable the Panel service and only run the Daemon:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop mcsm-web
sudo systemctl disable mcsm-web
sudo systemctl start mcsm-daemon
```

### Step 6: (Optional) Open Required Ports in Firewall
If you have enabled a firewall (such as UFW), allow the necessary ports for MCSManager and your games.

Check if the firewall is enabled:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Open the required ports for Panel and Daemon:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 23333
sudo ufw allow 24444
```

Open additional game ports as needed (example):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 2001
sudo ufw allow 2003
sudo ufw allow 2005
sudo ufw allow 19999
sudo ufw allow 17777
```

### Step 7: Access the Web Panel
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://your_server_ip:23333
```
Create your admin account and add a new Daemon.

### Step 8: Add a Daemon in the Panel
When adding a Daemon, provide the following:
- **Display Name:** Any name you like
- **Daemon IP:** Use `localhost` if Daemon is on the same server, or the remote server IP
- **Daemon Port:** Default is `24444`
- **Daemon Key:**
  - Key location in Linux: `/opt/mcsmanager/daemon/data/Config/global.json`
  - Key location in Windows: `<Panel Installation Path>/daemon/data/Config/global.json`

To view the daemon key on Linux:
```bash
sudo nano /opt/mcsmanager/daemon/data/Config/global.json
```

## Windows Installation

### Step 1: Download and Extract MCSManager
Go to [https://www.mcsmanager.com/](https://www.mcsmanager.com/) and click the Windows download button. Save and unzip MCSManager (suggested location: `C:\mcsmanager`).

### Step 2: Start Panel and Daemon Services
To run both Panel and Daemon, double-click `start.bat`.

### Step 3: Open Required Ports in Windows Advanced Firewall

1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
2. Type: <code>wf.msc</code> and press Enter
3. In the left pane, click: <b>Inbound Rules</b>
4. In the right pane, click: <b>New Rule...</b>
5. Select: <b>Port</b> → Click <b>Next</b>
6. Select: <b>TCP</b> (or <b>UDP</b>, if needed)
7. Select: <b>Specific local ports</b> → Enter: <code>23333,24444</code> (or a range like <code>23333-24444</code>) → Click <b>Next</b>
8. Select: <b>Allow the connection</b> → Click <b>Next</b>
9. Check network types: <b>Domain</b>, <b>Private</b>, <b>Public</b> → Click <b>Next</b>
10. Name the rule (e.g., <b>Open Ports 23333 and 24444</b>) → Click <b>Finish</b>

## Install and Run MCSManager Components: Panel & Daemon Separately

If you want to run only the Daemon on a remote server or separate the Panel and Daemon components:

### Linux
1. Run the installation script as described above.
2. Disable the Panel service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mcsm-web
   sudo systemctl disable mcsm-web
   sudo systemctl start mcsm-daemon
   ```

### Windows
1. Open the MCSManager folder and edit `start.bat` in Notepad.
2. Remove the following lines:
   `
   cd ../web
   start node_app.exe --enable-source-maps --max-old-space-size=8192 app.js --open
   `
3. Save the file and run the script.

## Troubleshooting
- If you cannot access the web panel or the daemon fails to connect, check that the required ports are open and not blocked by your firewall or Hetzner Firewall.
- If you have enabled a firewall in Hetzner Cloud or on a Hetzner Dedicated server, you also need to allow the required ports through the Hetzner firewall settings.
- Ensure Node.js is installed and the correct version is used (`node -v`).
- Check service status with `sudo systemctl status mcsm-daemon` and `sudo systemctl status mcsm-web`.
- Review logs in `/opt/mcsmanager/daemon/logs/` or the Windows log files for error messages.
- For more help, visit the MCSManager [official documentation](https://docs.mcsmanager.com) or community forums.
