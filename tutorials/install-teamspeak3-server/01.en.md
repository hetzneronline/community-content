## Introduction

Installation and configuration of the Teamspeak server software and setup of a service so that the software can be run in the background.

**Requirements**
+ A Linux or Windows server (Dedicated, KVM or LXC)
+ Root / Administrator rights on the system
+ A systemd compatible Linux

## Step 1 - Preparations

**Steps for Linux Systems**

Create a new user in whose context the Teamspeak server should be executed later.

```bash
root@your_host:~# useradd -m -s /bin/false ts
```

**Steps for Windows Systems**

Installing NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) will later register the Teamspeak server as a Windows service.

The latest version of NSSM can be downloaded here. (Latest release)
https://nssm.cc/download

Then simply open the downloaded ZIP file and navigate to the folder with the appropriate architecture of your server.

Here you can easily copy `nssm.exe` to `C:\Windows\System32\`

This completes the installation of NSSM.

## Step 2 - Installing the Teamspeak software

**Steps for Linux Systems**

Copy link of the appropriate Teamspeak software to the clipboard (second button)
https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#server

**For installation, the following steps must be performed on the system**

Download Teamspeak software (use the link copied above)

```bash
root@your_host:~# su --shell /bin/bash ts
ts@your_host:~$ wget -P /tmp/ https://files.teamspeak-services.com/releases/server/3.6.1/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.6.1.tar.bz2
```
Unpack the downloaded archive

```bash
ts@your_host:~$ tar xjf /tmp/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.6.1.tar.bz2 -C /home/ts
```

Accept Teamspeak license agreement

```bash
ts@your_host:~$ touch /home/ts/.ts3server_license_accepted
```

(optional) There are also other options available to accept the license agreement.

```bash
Please set the environment variable TS3SERVER_LICENSE to "accept" in order to accept the license agreement.

Alternatively, create a file named ".ts3server_license_accepted" in the working directory or start the server with the command line parameter "license_accepted=1".

To view the license agreement set TS3SERVER_LICENSE to "view" in order to print the license to the console.

Alternatively view the file "LICENSE" in your favorite text viewer yourself.
```

Change the file permissions

```bash
ts@your_host:~$ chmod +x /home/ts/ts3server_startscript.sh
ts@your_host:~$ chmod +x /home/ts/ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh
ts@your_host:~$ chmod +x /home/ts/ts3server
``` 

First start of the server (this data should be saved)

```bash
ts@your_host:~$ /home/ts/ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh

```

**Steps for Windows Systems**

Download the Teamspeak software from:
https://teamspeak.com/de/downloads/#server

Unpack the archive into a folder. (e.g. C:\teamspeak)

First start of the server
+ Accept license agreement
+ Save server query data
+ End server via the tray icon

## Step 3 - Setting up the service

In order for Teamspeak to be able to run as a background process without an active login, a service must be created.

**Steps for Linux Systems**

Create the service:

+ Create the systemd service
  ```bash
   root@your_host:~# nano /etc/systemd/system/ts.service
   ```
+ The following must be inserted into the file
   ```bash
   [Unit]
    Description=TeamSpeak 3 Server
    After=network.service

   [Service]
    User=ts
    Group=ts
    Type=forking
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ts/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64/
    ExecStart=/home/ts/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64/ts3server_startscript.sh start
    ExecStop=/home/ts/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64/ts3server_startscript.sh stop
    PIDFile=/home/ts/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64/ts3server.pid
    RestartSec=15
    Restart=always

   [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   
Register the service:

+ Load new service entries and changes
  ```bash
  root@your_host:~# systemctl daemon-reload
  ```
+ Activate service (will be started automatically after a reboot)
  ```bash
  root@your_host:~# systemctl enable ts.service
  ```

The following command can be used to manage the service.
```bash
root@your_host:~# systemctl start/stop/restart ts.service
 ``` 

**Steps for Windows Systems**

Start NSSM via CMD (parameter is the service name)

```cmd
C:\Users\Administrator>nssm install teamspeak
```

In the "Application" tab, on "Path" the Teamspeak Server application path must be specified. (e.g. C:\Users\Administrator\teamspeak\ts3server.exe)

On "Startup directory" you have to specify the whole application folder. (in this case C:\Users\Administrator\teamspeak\ )

All other settings are optional. If you want to change something afterwards, you can edit the service with the command `nssm edit teamspeak`.

Afterwards the Teamspeak server can be used normally as a Windows service.

## Conclusion

This article has shown what steps are necessary to install a Teamspeak 3 server on Windows or Linux systems and register the Teamspeak software as a service.
