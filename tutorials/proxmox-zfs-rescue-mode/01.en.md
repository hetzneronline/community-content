# ZFS Rescue Mode Documentation for Proxmox Server

This tutorial describes how to mount ZFS filesystems in rescue mode to fix network configuration or other system issues on a Proxmox server with a ZFS RAID0 configuration.

### Mounting ZFS Pools in Rescue Mode

This document describes how to access the ZFS file system while in rescue mode to fix network configuration or other system issues on a Proxmox server.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to your server's rescue mode
- Server with ZFS-based storage (like Proxmox with ZFS RAID0)

#### Step 1: Identify Available ZFS Pools

Check which ZFS pools can be detected on your system:

```bash
zpool import
```

#### Step 2: Import the ZFS Pool

Import the pool (replace "rpool" with your pool name if different):

```bash
zpool import rpool
```

#### Step 3: Verify Pool Status

Check the status of the imported pool to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
zpool status
```

#### Step 4: List ZFS Datasets

List all available datasets to identify the root filesystem:

```bash
zfs list
```

Typically for Proxmox, your output will show something like:

```
NAME               USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
rpool             1.81G   913G   104K  /rpool
rpool/ROOT        1.81G   913G    96K  /rpool/ROOT
rpool/ROOT/pve-1  1.81G   913G  1.81G  /
rpool/data          96K   913G    96K  /rpool/data
rpool/var-lib-vz    96K   913G    96K  /var/lib/vz
```

#### Step 5: Mount the Root Filesystem

Create a temporary mount point and mount the root filesystem:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/proxmox
zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/proxmox rpool/ROOT/pve-1
zfs mount rpool/ROOT/pve-1
```

#### Step 6: Access and Edit Files

Now you can access and edit system files, including network configuration:

```bash
nano /mnt/proxmox/etc/network/interfaces
```

#### Step 7: Restore Original Mount Point and Clean Up

After making your changes, restore the original mount point and clean up:

```bash
zfs umount rpool/ROOT/pve-1
zfs set mountpoint=/ rpool/ROOT/pve-1
zpool export rpool
```

#### Step 8: Reboot

Exit rescue mode and reboot your system:

```bash
reboot
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues importing the pool, try forcing the import:

```bash
zpool import -f rpool
```

If the pool name isn't recognized, try:

```bash
zpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id
```
