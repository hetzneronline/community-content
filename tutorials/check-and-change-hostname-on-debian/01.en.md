## Introduction

The hostname of a Linux system is an important component of the system. You cannot only use it to identify the system for yourself but also for software, which often needs a correctly set hostname for clear identification. In functionality, the hostname will bring up a name for your IP address. The hostname is a domain name given to a host machine. You can set different hostnames, but to get fully qualified, we should set just one per host.

If you only have one server for a small static webpage, for example, you can use something like `foo.bar`. 

The reccomended way, however, is to choose a name that is representable of the server, for example:
* `mail` for a mailserver
* `web` for a webserver

**Prerequisites**

- To make the hostname fully qualified, you need to set the rDNS entry of your machine to the wanted FQHN (fully qualified hostname). You can do this in the web console of your server.

- To make your hostname fully qualified, you need to create an "A" record in your DNS zone for your hostname. So in our example for the first little server for our domain `foo.bar`, we create an "A" record with the value `srv1.foo.bar` and the IP address to the one of our machine. After 12-48 hours the DNS changes should be globally propagated.

- To check and change the hostname on your server, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

- This guide is based on a server with a fresh installion of Debian 12.

**Example terminology**

In our example (a little server for just different things) we use `srv1.foo.bar` so we can later — if we need more servers — just name the next one `srv2.foo.bar`.

## Step 1 - Check the hostname

To check the actual hostname, there are three different ways.

* First:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /etc/hostname
  sudo cat /etc/hosts
  ```

* Second:
  ```bash
  sudo hostname
  ```

* Third:
  ```bash
  sudo hostname -f
  ```

The last option will show you the fully qualified hostname.

## Step 2 - Change the hostname

There are different ways to change the hostname.

#### Change the hostname via a command

The simplest method would be this option:

> Replace `servername.fqdn.tld` to your server's fully qualified hostname.

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname servername.fqdn.tld
```

Then, restart the SSH service and the new hostname is set:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### Change the hostname manually

You can also change the hostname manually. Just open some files and change/check the hostname:

* Hostname in `/etc/hostname`
  
  In this file only the name of the server should appear. In our case "servername". If not or you want to do it manually, just change it to the wanted name.
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/hostname
  ```

* Mailname in `/etc/mailname`  
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/mailname
  ```

* Hostname in `/etc/hosts`
  ```bash
  nano /etc/hosts
  ```
  It should look something like this:
  ```conf
  127.0.1.1 servername.fqdn.tld servername
  127.0.0.1 localhost
  
  ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback servername.fqdn.tld servername
  fe00::0 ip6-localnet
  ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
  ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
  ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
  ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
  ```
  Here you can see where the hostname is set and just change it to the one you want.

After you saved the changes, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully checked and changed the hostname of your server.
