## Introduction

The hostname of a linux system is an important component of the system. Not only that one can identify one's own system here, also software often needs a correctly set hostname for the clear identification.

**Prerequisites**

To check and change the hostname on your server, make sure you are logged into your server with a sudo user.

This guide is based on a fresh installed debian 9 cloud server.

## Step 1 - Check the actual hostname

To check the actual hostname, u have three different ways. For the first u can type:

```sudo cat /etc/hosts```


The second command to let u show the hostname is:

```sudo hostname```


and the last way is:

```sudo hostname -f``` 


where the last option show you the configured fully qualified hostname.

## Step 2 - Change the actual hostname

Also when changing the hostname we have different possibilities. The simplest method would be this option:

```sudo hostnamectl set-hostname servername.fqdn.tld```

Here u just need to change servername.fqdn.tld to your servers fully qualified hostname, and the daemon will done the rest. Then we restart the SSH service and the new hostname is set:

```sudo systemctl restart ssh```


So yes, u also can change the hostname manually. To check if the command set it right and changing it manually is similiar the same. We just open some files and change/check the hostname if its right:

```sudo nano /etc/hostname```


In this file just the name of the server should appear. In our case "servername". If not or u wanna do it manually, just change it to the wanted name. Next we check, if the mailname is the same:

```sudo nano /etc/mailname```


Eventually this file do not appear. In this case its not bad, if u dont have a mailserver on the machine. If u will later setup one, u setup the mailname anyway.
Also we check our /etc/hosts file:

```nano /etc/hosts```


It should look something like this:

    127.0.1.1 servername.fqdn.tld servername
    127.0.0.1 localhost
    
    ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback servername.fqdn.tld servername
    fe00::0 ip6-localnet
    ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
    ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
	
Here u can see where the hostname is set and just change it to your needs.

After the changes, if wo done some manually, we restart the ssh service:
```sudo systemctl restart ssh```

## Conclusion

Finally, you have successfully checked and changes the hostname of your server.
