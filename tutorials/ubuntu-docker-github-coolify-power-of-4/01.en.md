## Introduction

This guide shows how to combine the “Power of 4” — Ubuntu + Docker + GitHub + Coolify — to deploy a containerized web app on a Hetzner Cloud server with automated builds and HTTPS.

By the end, you will have:
* A secured Ubuntu host with Docker and Compose.
* A sample app stored on GitHub with a Dockerfile.
* Coolify installed to auto-build and deploy from your repo with TLS.

## Prerequisites

* Hetzner Cloud server (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04), public IP, and SSH access.
* A domain or subdomain pointing to the server IP (A/AAAA record).
* GitHub account and a personal access token with `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes for Coolify.
* (Recommended) An SSH key on the server and in your GitHub account.

## Architecture: the Power of 4

![Power of 4 Architecture](./architecture.png)


1. **Ubuntu**: stable base OS.
2. **Docker**: container runtime for reproducible builds.
3. **GitHub**: source of truth and build trigger.
4. **Coolify**: PaaS layer to pull, build, run, and manage SSL.

## Step 1 — Prepare the server

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg git ufw
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH && sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 2 — Install Docker and Compose plugin

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Step 3 — Create a sample app and push to GitHub

If you have an app already, ensure it has a `Dockerfile`. Otherwise, create a simple Node example:

```bash
mkdir power-of-4-app && cd power-of-4-app
cat > server.js <<'EOF'
const http = require('http');
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const msg = `Hello from the Power of 4: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n`;
http.createServer((_, res) => { res.writeHead(200); res.end(msg); }).listen(port);
console.log(`Listening on ${port}`);
EOF

cat > package.json <<'EOF'
{ "name": "power-of-4", "version": "1.0.0", "main": "server.js", "scripts": { "start": "node server.js" } }
EOF

cat > Dockerfile <<'EOF'
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./ 
RUN npm install --production || npm install --omit=dev
COPY . .
ENV PORT=3000
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
EOF
```

Initialize and push:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Power of 4 app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4 — Install Coolify on Ubuntu

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, open `http://<server-ip>:3000`, create the admin account, and complete onboarding.

## Step 5 — Add your domain to the server

1. Create an A record (and AAAA if using IPv6) pointing your domain/subdomain to the server IP.
2. In Coolify, go to **Infrastructure → Servers → Domains** and add the domain so Coolify can issue TLS later.

## Step 6 — Connect GitHub to Coolify

1. In Coolify: **Settings → Git Providers → Add GitHub**.
2. Paste a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes.
3. Save; Coolify will verify access.

## Step 7 — Deploy the app from GitHub

1. In Coolify, create/select a Project → **New Resource → Application**.
2. Choose **Git** → select your repo and `main` branch.
3. Build settings:
   * **Type**: Dockerfile
   * **Dockerfile path**: `Dockerfile`
   * **Port**: `3000`
4. Select the server as the deployment target, then click **Deploy**. Coolify will clone, build, and run the container.

## Step 8 — Enable HTTPS

1. In the app’s **Domain** settings, add your domain/subdomain.
2. Toggle **Enable SSL**; Coolify will request a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
3. Redeploy if prompted. Visit `https://your-domain` to verify.

## Step 9 — Verify and update

* Check logs: **Application → Logs**.
* Health check: `curl -I https://your-domain`.
* To deploy updates: commit to `main` and push; trigger a redeploy in Coolify (or enable auto-deploy on push).

## Maintenance and troubleshooting

* Restart app: **Application → Settings → Restart**.
* If build fails: confirm Dockerfile path and port match the app.
* If TLS fails: verify DNS has propagated and port 80/443 are open.

## Conclusion

You combined Ubuntu, Docker, GitHub, and Coolify to ship a containerized app with repeatable builds, zero-downtime redeploys, and automatic HTTPS. Extend this by adding databases in Coolify, staging environments, or GitHub Actions for CI tests before deployment.

**Next steps:**

* Add a database resource in Coolify (PostgreSQL/Redis) and bind env vars.
* Protect main with GitHub branch rules and required checks.
* Explore autoscaling or backups for stateful services.

## Advanced Customizations 🎨

### Theme & UI Tweaks
- Customize the Coolify UI theme by editing the `coolify.yml` file. Use CSS variables to match your brand colors.
- Enable dark mode for a sleek look: add `--theme: dark` under the **Appearance** settings.

### Monitoring & Logging 📈
- Integrate Prometheus and Grafana with Coolify to monitor container metrics.
- Enable log streaming in **Application → Logs** and forward to a centralized ELK stack.

## Troubleshooting Tips 🛠️
- **Docker daemon not responding**: Run `sudo systemctl restart docker` and verify with `docker ps`.
- **GitHub webhook failures**: Ensure the webhook secret matches the one configured in Coolify.
- **TLS handshake errors**: Confirm ports 80/443 are open and DNS propagation is complete.

## FAQ 🤔
**Q:** Can I deploy multiple apps on the same server?
**A:** Yes, Coolify supports multiple projects; just allocate distinct domains.

**Q:** How to roll back a deployment?
**A:** Use the **Deployments** tab in Coolify and click **Rollback** on a previous successful build.

## Bonus: CI/CD Integration 🚀
Add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests before Coolify builds:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
This ensures only passing code reaches Coolify.
