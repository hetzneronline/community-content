# Install Nvidia graphics drivers on your server

## Introduction

This tutorial explains how you can install the nvidia-drivers on Ubuntu.  

**Prerequisites**

* A dedicated server with a Nvidia GPU (for example the [EX51-SSD-GPU](https://www.hetzner.de/dedicated-rootserver/ex51-ssd-gpu))

## Step 1 - Connect to your server

If you already have a server you should connect to it via SSH.  

## Step 2- Add the Ubuntu Graphics driver ppa

Now you should add the graphics driver apt repository. You can do that by executing:  
`add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers`  
Once that is done you should execute `apt update`

## Step 3 - Install the driver

Now you want to install the driver. But first you will have to lookup the latest version of the driver. You can do this by opening this [page](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) and looking for the last `nvidia-graphics-drivers-xxx` package. Then if this package for example is `nvidia-graphics-drivers-418` you want to install this driver version by executing: `apt install -y nvidia-driver-418` on (Ubuntu 18.04) / `apt install -y  nvidia-418` on (Ubuntu 16.04)  

## Step 4 - Reboot your server and check if everything works

The driver is now installed, you should reboot your server so the new kernel extensions get loaded. Once your server is rebooted you can execute `nvidia-smi` to see if your GPU is detected.

## Step 5 - Upgrading the driver

If you want to upgrade the driver you simply have to uninstall it by executing `apt purge nvidia*` and then reinstall the new driver the same way like in step 3.
