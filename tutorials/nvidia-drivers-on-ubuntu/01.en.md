## Introduction

This tutorial explains how you can install the Nvidia drivers on Ubuntu.

**Prerequisites**

* A dedicated server with a Nvidia GPU (for example the [EX51-SSD-GPU](https://www.hetzner.de/dedicated-rootserver/ex51-ssd-gpu))

## Step 1- Add the Ubuntu Graphics driver ppa

First you should add the graphics driver apt repository. You can do that by running:
`add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers`

Once that is done you should run `apt update`.

## Step 2 - Install the driver

Now you want to install the driver. First you will have to lookup the latest version of the driver. You can do this by opening this [page](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) and looking for the most recent `nvidia-graphics-drivers-xxx` package.

If this package for example is `nvidia-graphics-drivers-418`, then you want to install this driver version by running:
`apt install -y nvidia-driver-418` (on Ubuntu 18.04) / `apt install -y  nvidia-418` (on Ubuntu 16.04)

## Step 3 - Reboot your server

Once the driver is installed, you should reboot your server so the new kernel extensions get loaded. Once your server is rebooted you can run `nvidia-smi` to see if your GPU is detected.

## Step 4 - Upgrade the driver (Optional)

If you want to upgrade the driver you simply have to uninstall it by running `apt purge nvidia*` and then reinstall the new driver the same way the old driver was installed in Step 2.
