## Introduction

In this tutorial we will install [Outline](https://getoutline.org/), a VPN server developed by Jigsaw.

## Step 1 - Create a new Cloud server

* Login to your cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Create new project and name it whatever you want
* Choose your server location - it's up to you
* Click `Add Server` and select `Ubuntu 18.04` from Image
* Choose the resources you need from Type
* Click on the field `User Data` and enter `#include https://get.docker.com` (this will install docker)
* Select your SSH-Key
  * You can read [this](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article to know how to generate SSH key
* Write your server hostname in `name` input
* Click `Create & Buy Now`

## Step 2 - Download the Outline clients

You will need to download two clients. The Outline Manager to administrate your server and the Outline Client to establish the VPN connection.

Outline Manager download links:
[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases/master/manager/stable/Outline-Manager.exe)  
[MacOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases/master/manager/stable/Outline-Manager.dmg)  
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases/master/manager/stable/Outline-Manager.AppImage)  

Outline Client download links:
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.outline.android.client)  
[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases/master/client/stable/Outline-Client.exe)  
[ChromeOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.outline.android.client)  
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outline-app/id1356177741)  
[MacOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outline-app/id1356178125)  
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases/master/client/stable/Outline-Client.AppImage)  

## Step 3 - Install updates on the server (Optional)

Wait a few seconds for the server to startup and then connect to it using SSH and your private key.
Now you should install available updates on your server by running:

`apt update && apt upgrade -y`

## Step 4 - Install the Outline Server

Once you have installed the Outline manager and the Outline client you can go ahead and open the manager. Once it has started select `Setup Outline anywhere`.

Now we are going to install the server itself. To do that execute the following command:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/master/src/server_manager/install_scripts/install_server.sh | bash
```

When you are asked if you want to install Docker answer with `y`.

Now you should get an output in your log that looks like this:

```
CONGRATULATIONS! Your Outline server is up and running.

To manage your Outline server, please copy the following line (including curly
brackets) into Step 2 of the Outline Manager interface:

{"apiUrl":"https://10.0.0.1:6311/dPvv3xoyNNzEpR9rC_RKQA","certSha256":"C517734428F9AC58D37373E81466930799C13C770C1809B8CECAAB30B06F0F42"}

If you have connection problems, it may be that your router or cloud provider
blocks inbound connections, even though your machine seems to allow them.

Make sure to open the following ports on your firewall, router or cloud provider:
- Management port 6311, for TCP
- Access key port 48682, for TCP and UDP
```

Copy the following output from the SSH console:
`{"apiUrl":"https://10.0.0.1:6311/dPvv3xoyNNzEpR9rC_RKQA" "certSha256":"C517734428F9AC58D37373E81466930799C13C770C1809B8CECAAB30B06F0F42"}`  
And paste it into the Outline manager. Once you click on `Done` you will be presented with the connections dashboard.

## Step 5 - Connect to your VPN server

In the manager you can click on the computer icon near the `My access key`. Now you can select if you want to connect this device or another device.
If you choose this device the Outline client will start and connect to your server.
If you choose `connect a different device` you will get an s3 link that you can simply copy and open on the other device. You will then be shown the ssh:// link that you will need to enter in the Outline client on that device.

## Step 6 -  Enable automatic server upgrades

If you don't want to have to worry about your server being up to date, you can simply enable automatic upgrades by running:
`dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades`  

In the prompt that appears select yes and you are all done.

## Conclusion

Have fun using your secure VPN connection anywhere anytime.
