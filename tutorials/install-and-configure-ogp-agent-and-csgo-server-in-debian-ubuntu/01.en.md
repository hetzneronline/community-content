## Introduction

In this tutorial we will be installing the Agent of OGP which is responsible for running game servers.
We will also learn to run a basic CSGO game server using it. You can also follow similar procedure to run various other supported game servers.

*We can install Agent in same server where Panel is installed or we can install it in a totally fresh server and link it to panel running on different server.*

**Prerequisites**

* A server with either Debian (9 or 10) or Ubuntu (18.04 or 16.04).
* Open Game Panel already installed and configured. You can follow the [previous tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-ogp-panel-in-debian-ubuntu) to do so.

## Step 1 - Agent Prerequisites

In this step we will be installing the packages that are needed to run the agent.

**Note:** If you are using Debian 10 or lower make sure you have sudo installed. If not then go ahead and install sudo using `apt-get install sudo` using your root account.

Add your user to sudoer if not already done, using:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo "{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LINUX_USERNAME}"
```

Make sure your server is up-to-date (this works for all distributions):

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

Then install the required packages.

For all versions of Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl libpath-class-perl perl-modules screen rsync sudo e2fsprogs unzip subversion libarchive-extract-perl pure-ftpd libarchive-zip-perl libc6 libgcc1 git curl libc6-i386 libgcc1:i386 lib32gcc1 libhttp-daemon-perl
```

For all versions of Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl libpath-class-perl perl-modules screen rsync sudo e2fsprogs unzip subversion pure-ftpd libarchive-zip-perl libc6 libgcc1 git curl libc6-i386 lib32gcc1 libhttp-daemon-perl libarchive-extract-perl
```

## Step 2 - Installing the Agent

Now we will download the Agent Easy-Installer of OGP and run it.

### Step 2.1 Download & Install

```bash
wget "https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/Easy-Installers/raw/master/Linux/Debian-Ubuntu/ogp-agent-latest.deb"
sudo dpkg -i "ogp-agent-latest.deb"
```

The OGP agent user (with sudo access) will be created automatically for you by the installer with a random password. To view the automatically generated encryption key, OGP username, and OGP user password, run the following command:

```bash
sudo cat /root/ogp_user_password
```

It will returns something like this:

```bash
root@local# sudo cat /root/ogp_user_password
ogpUser=ogp_agent
ogpPass=piLKDZYlAsAavRj
ogpEnc=wq6yw4s5
```

You'll need the encryption key for the panel. *In this case: wq6yw4s5*

### Step 2.2 Add to Panel

Now open the Panel in your browser and navigate to the servers section:
`Administration -> Servers`

"Add New Remote Host" form will be displayed. Fill the form as per your server credentials:

```bash
Remote Host: Your_Server_Ip
Remote Host Port: 12679
Remote Host Name: Any_Unique_Name_You_Want
FTP IP: Your_Server_Ip
FTP Port: 21
Remote Encryption Key: Agent_Encryption_Key
Time Out: 5
Use NAT: off
Display Public IP: Your_Server_Ip
```

Click on "Add Remote Host" button once you filled the form. You will get a green success message if everything is done as per tutorial.

You will be able to see your server added in Remote Host section just below the form. It should show your server status as "Online"

Congrats! OGP Agent is now installed and added to your Panel. You can now add and run supported game servers in it.

## Step 3 - Running a CSGO Server (Optional)

Counter Strike Global Offensive is a supported game server in OGP. If you want to run a CSGO server you can continue to read below (or you can go ahead and run other game servers).

Open the Panel in your browser and navigate to Game Servers section:
`Administration -> Game Servers`

Click on "Add new game server" button.

It will show a dropdown to select the Agent you want to add the game server to. Select your agent from the dropdown and the page will reload with a new form asking for Game Type.

Select `Counter Strike Global Offensive (Linux)` from the dropdown and click "Add game server" leaving every other option as default.

It will create your server and open up the editing section of the server. In this section you can change the name of server, set a game password, etc.

Scroll down to the "IPs and Ports" section and assign any port you like to the server, and then go back to the Game Monitor section using `<<Back to Game Monitor` button.

Now we need to install the CSGO Server files from Steam. Click on `Install/Update via Steam` button and let the download complete.

Once it is completed you can start the game server by clicking Start Server.

CSGO servers requires a token called GSLT. OGP will ask you for the token before starting the server.
You can get one from here: [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers)

Your CSGO server is now ready.

## Conclusion

Your OGP Agent is installed and added to the Panel which can be used to run hundreds of supported games with ease.
