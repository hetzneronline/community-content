# Install Apache2 with LetsEncrypt 

## Introduction

In this Tutorial we will install on a blank Server an Apache2 Webserver, change the Servername and install on it an fresh LetsEncrypt Certificate

**Prerequisites**

Operating System can be an Debian 9.0, Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04. Other distributions not tested

## Step 1 - Install Apache2

In the first step we will update the system with apt and install needed software:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get install apache2
```
The Server will ask you, that packages should be install. Answer with "y".


## Step 2 - Install LetsEncrpt

In this step we install the basically LetsEncrypt Module for Apache2, that generate the Certificate.
```bash
apt install python-certbot-apache
```

## Step 3 - Change Servername Vhost

The Apache 2 configuration files are located in ```/etc/apache2```. That LetsEncrpt can set the SSL Settings in the right configuration file, we must change the servername.
In this Example, the server called ```test1.test.de```.

Edit the configuration file ```/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf``` and uncomment the line

```bash
#ServerName www.example.com
```

and change to

```bash
ServerName test1.test.de
```

After that, save the file.

## Step 4 - Create LetsEncrypt Certificate
To create the Certificate, enter the following command

```bash
certbot --apache -d test1.test.de
```

LetsEncrpt generate the certficate now for you.

```bash
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator apache, Installer apache
Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:
http-01 challenge for test1.test.de
Waiting for verification...
Cleaning up challenges
```

The CertBot ask you, what method you will use:

```bash
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
change by editing your web server's configuration.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```
We enter 2, then all HTTP connections will be redirect to HTTPS.

Congratulation, your SSL Certificate is working. The Certbot restart the Webserver for you.
