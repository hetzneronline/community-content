## Introduction

[Hetzner's Rescue
System](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/troubleshooting/hetzner-rescue-system)
includes the
[installimage](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage)
tool, which automates installing popular Linux distributions on dedicated
servers.

This tutorial shows how to use `installimage` to install **Debian with
full-disk encryption** on **two NVMe drives** using a software RAID with LVM.

```
MD RAID ➔ LUKS ➔ LVM ➔ filesystem
```

In addition remote unlocking via SSH (`dropbear`) embedded in the `initramfs`,
with the `initramfs` stored on a separate unencrypted `/boot` partition is
explained. The steps were tested on an `AX41-NVMe` dedicated server with Debian
11.1 Bullseye and Debian 13.0 Trixie. It should work with Debian 12.12
Bookworm.

**Prerequisites**

* Hetzner account
* Server with IPv4 address booted into the rescue system
* RSA or ECDSA/ED25519 SSH public key (can be created on the fly)
* No private networks attached on Hetzner Cloud

## Step 1 - Create or copy SSH public key

In order to remotely unlock the encrypted disk at least one SSH key is
required. This key will also be used to later log in to the booted system. The
`dropbear` SSH daemon (version 2020.81-3) included in Debian 11.1 supports
Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) and elliptic curve keys, so does 2025.88-2 in
Debian 13.0. If you do not have such a key, you need to generate one. This can
be the case if a password is used to access the rescue system. In case you
already have such a key in `~/.ssh/{authorized,robot_user}_keys`, continue with
step 2. (The `installimage` script can use an additional `robot_user_keys` file
for installation keys.)

For example, to generate `ed25519` (a non *National Institute of Standards and
Technology* (NIST) elliptic-curve) SSH key run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Copy the public key to the rescue system and add it to existing keys.

```bash
cat id_ed25519.pub|ssh root@<your-host> -T 'cat>>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys'
cat id_ed25519.pub|ssh root@<your-host> -T 'cat>>/root/.ssh/robot_user_keys'
```

## Step 2 - Create or copy installimage configuration file

When `installimage` is called without any options, it will search for the file
`/autosetup`. If it does not find it, it starts in interactive mode and will
open an editor after a distribution image has been selected. On exiting the
editor, the installation will proceed and the corresponding configuration is
saved as `/installimage.conf` on the filesystem of the installed system. In
this tutorial we will use such a configuration to install directly via the
`/autosetup` file.

Create the file `/autosetup` with the following content or copy it to the
server running the rescue system.

*Note 1:* Replace `<secret>` with a secure password and adjust drive names and
partitioning as needed. Usually *Linux Unified Key Setup* (LUKS) via `cryptsetup`
is configured for a maximum password length of 512 characters (the maximum
length was not verified for this tutorial).

*Note 2:* If installing in UEFI mode, you must add `PART /boot/efi  esp  256M`.
This tutorial installed Debian 13 without UEFI. However this might be
considered for other OSes, different hardware  or future version of Debian.

*Note 3:* To understand what image file names are available, see
<https://download.hetzner.com/bootimages/> and use credentials provided via
e-mail or use the `installimage` script until you see the image name you would
like to use (press ESC and then choose 'exit' to quit). The usage and creation
of custom images is not covered in this guide. Be aware that the naming
convention for Debian versions is to omit the first zero. It is **Debian 13.0**
for example, however the corresponding Hetzner image is **Debian-1300..**.

```conf
CRYPTPASSWORD <secret>

SWRAID 1
SWRAIDLEVEL 1
DRIVE1 /dev/nvme0n1
DRIVE2 /dev/nvme1n1

#PART  /boot/efi  esp    256M # Only needed in UEFI mode, see note 2 above
PART  /boot  ext4    2G
PART  lvm    vg0    all crypt

LV  vg0  swap  swap  swap 32G
LV  vg0  root  /     xfs  all

BOOTLOADER grub

HOSTNAME <host.example.com>

# For custom images:
# IMAGEPATH
# IMAGE
# For Hetzner images:
# IMAGE /root/images/Debian-1107-bullseye-amd64-base.tar.gz
# IMAGE /root/images/Debian-1208-bookworm-amd64-base.tar.gz
IMAGE /root/images/Debian-1300-trixie-amd64-base.tar.gz

SSHKEYS_URL /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This example configures 32GB of swap, 2GB for `/boot` and uses the `xfs`
filesystem (better for large files). Other values or filesystems, like `ext4`
are possible.

## Step 3 - Create or copy post-install script

In order to remotely unlock the encrypted partition, we need to install and add
the `dropbear` SSH server to the `initramfs` which is stored on the unencrypted
`/boot` partition. This will also trigger the inclusion of `dhclient` to
configure networking, but without any extras. To enable support for Hetzner
Cloud, we need to add a hook which includes support for RFC3442 routes.

In order to run these additional steps we need a post-install script for
`installimage`.

Create a file `/tmp/post-install.sh` on the rescue system with the following
content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

add_rfc3442_hook() {
  cat << EOF > /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
#!/bin/sh

PREREQ=""

prereqs()
{
        echo "\$PREREQ"
}

case \$1 in
prereqs)
        prereqs
        exit 0
        ;;
esac

if [ ! -x /sbin/dhclient ]; then
        exit 0
fi

. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions
. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions

mkdir -p \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
cp -a /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/rfc3442-classless-routes \$DESTDIR/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
EOF

  chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/add-rfc3442-dhclient-hook
}

# (1) Install hook
add_rfc3442_hook

# (2) Copy SSH keys for dropbear
#     Detect Debian version
VERSION_ID=$(grep VERSION_ID /etc/os-release | sed -e 's/.*"\(.*\)"/\1/')
echo "Detected Debian $VERSION_ID"

case "$VERSION_ID" in
  11|12)
    echo "Copy authorized_keys to /etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys"
    mkdir -p /etc/dropbear-initramfs
    cp -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys
    ;;
  13)
    echo "Copy authorized_keys to /etc/dropbear/initramfs/authorized_keys"
    mkdir -p /etc/dropbear/initramfs
    cp -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/dropbear/initramfs/authorized_keys
    ;;
  *)
    echo "WARNING: Unknown Debian version ($VERSION_ID)!"
    echo "(You will not be able to log in)"
    exit 2
    ;;
esac

# (3) Update system
apt-get update >/dev/null
apt-get -y install cryptsetup-initramfs dropbear-initramfs
```

Important note: make the post-install script executable:

```bash
chmod +x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

## Step 4 - Start installation

Before starting the installation, check again the content of the following
files:

* `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` - our public SSH key(s) (RSA or ECDSA/ed25519)
* `/autosetup` - `installimage` configuration
* `/tmp/post-install.sh` - is executable and contains the post-install script

Now we are ready to start the installation with the following command:

```bash
installimage -x /tmp/post-install.sh
```

If you want to capture parts of the visible output or measure the time,
you can use this command instead:

```bash
time installimage -x /tmp/post-install.sh |tee -a /root/my-install.log
```

Wait until the installation completes and check the `/root/debug.txt` and the
screen output (or `my-install.log`) for any errors. For Debian 13 the
installation takes less than 2 minutes.

In the screen output the following 2 lines show a successful configuration, in
this case Debian 13:

```bash
Detected Debian 13
Copy authorized_keys to /etc/dropbear/initramfs/authorized_keys
```

## Step 5 - Boot installed system

After the installation has finished and any errors are resolved (see section
**debugging** below in case), we can run `reboot` to restart the server and
boot the newly installed `initramfs`. We can watch the boot process if we
have a KVM attached or via remote console on a cloud instance.

After some time the server should respond to ping. Now log in via SSH into
`BusyBox` `initramfs` shell provided by `dropbear` and run the command
`cryptroot-unlock` to unlock the encrypted partition(s) from the `BusyBox`
command line.

```
ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@<your-host>

The authenticity of host '<your-host> (<your-host>)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:uY/i2eu8jee8RB9aWwapQquSO+G6E/VMorWQ1fA9clM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '<your-host>' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
To unlock root partition, and maybe others like swap, run `cryptroot-unlock`.


BusyBox v1.37.0 (Debian 1:1.37.0-6+b3) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

~ # cryptroot-unlock
Please unlock disk luks-53152dbf-856e-4e13-b09f-8d05f01a43bc:
cryptsetup: luks-53152dbf-856e-4e13-b09f-8d05f01a43bc set up successfully
~ # Connection to <your-host> closed by remote host.
Connection to <your-host> closed.
```

If the password is correct the boot from the `initramfs` will continue to the
new installed system. Before the new system is up and running, we will
automatically be disconnected from the temporary SSH session of the `initramfs`.

After a few seconds we can log in to our new system via SSH into. Be aware that
if we use the same name to connect to the `initramfs` of `BusyBox` via SSH
(`dropbear`) and to the booted system, SSH will give warnings about a changed
host name. It is advised to use different names. Either by using IP and name or
by setting up two different DNS names for the same IP. By doing this we keep
the SSH function of warning if the booted server host (Debian) fingerprint
changes.

## Step 6 - Verification (Optional)

The correct installation can be verified by `lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT`
either from the rescue system or from the booted
system. The hierarchy of `NVMe ➔ MD (RAID) ➔ LUKS ➔ LVM ➔ XFS` is
clearly visible:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
NAME                                            FSTYPE          SIZE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1                                                           476.9G

│ └─md0                                         ext4                  2G /boot
└─nvme0n1p2                                     linux_raid_member 474.9G

      └─vg0-root                                xfs               442.8G /

      └─vg0-root                                xfs               442.8G /

```

## Step 7 - Harden the system (Optional)

Writing the `cryptsetup` password inside the `/autosetup` file is very
convenient. A copy of this file is placed on the installed root filesystem as
`/installimage.conf`. And not in `/root/debug.txt` but in `/installimage.debug`
we can find a line like `Sent install.conf to statsserver: HTTP/2 201`.

It is possible to update the `cryptsetup` password with a different one
manually after the initial setup via `/autosetup`. The update procedure do
**not** require to store the password in a text file.

First test which slot the `cryptsetup` password is stored. Usually it is slot 0.
This can be done with `cryptsetup --verbose open --test-passphrase <DEVICE>`.

```bash
cryptsetup --verbose open --test-passphrase /dev/md1
Enter passphrase for /dev/md1: <secret>
Key slot 0 unlocked.
Command successful.
```

Usually this should give the same result, but will display other
slots in the case more than one slot is used:

```bash
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/md1|grep luks2
  0: luks2
```

To change the `cryptsetup` password, set the password for slot 0 with:

```bash
cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/md1 -S 0
Enter LUKS passphrase to be changed:
Enter new LUKS passphrase:
```

## Step 8 - Debugging (Optional)

The `installimage` is not idempotent in regard to software RAID. The devices
`/dev/md0` and `/dev/md1` will exists after the first run. If we would run the
`installimage` twice to reinstall the machine we will get errors like `Device
/dev/md/1 is in use`. In this case **remove** and **stop** the software RAID
before running `installimage` again. Also it might be advisable to **delete**
`mdadm` meta data. If the meta data is not deleted, the old metadata will
remain on the devices, but will appear older than the new metadata and so will
usually be ignored. The old metadata can be removed by giving the option
`--zero-superblock`.  This was **not** tested for this tutorial. Note: Be
careful to call `--zero-superblock` with clustered RAID, make sure the array
isn't used or assembled in an other cluster node before execute it.

```bash
mdadm --remove /dev/md0
mdadm --remove /dev/md1
mdadm --stop /dev/md0
mdadm --stop /dev/md1
```

## Conclusion

After configuration and executing `installimage`, booting into the
`initramfs`, entering the `cryptsetup` password, the installed system is
booted with a two-tier process and can be used.

While the boot or reboot of the system needs one additional step (the manual
SSH session to the `BusyBox` `initramfs`) it adds a layer of security towards
the storage subsystem. However an unattended reboot is not possible with this
`dropbear` setup.

The tutorial for Debian 11
(`install-debian-11-with-lvm-encrypted-nvme-software-raid`) was inspired by
[How to install Ubuntu 20.04 with full disk
encryption](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-2004-with-full-disk-encryption)
and parts (for example the cloud hook) had been copied under the MIT license at
2022-04-07.

This tutorial for Debian in general, tested with Debian 13, and hopefully for
other future versions of Debian improves on the former Debian 11 tutorial with
various changes to wording, typos, some changes to installation (for example
adding `robot_user_keys`, changes of package names due to Debian 13) and minor
other configuration changes (for example using 2GB for /boot, to add more space
for kernels).
