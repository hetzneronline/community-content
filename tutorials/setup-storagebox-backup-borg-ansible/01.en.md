## Introduction

I am running multiple VMs on multiple Servers. Most of them on Hetzner Rootservers, some on my personal server at home. I used to use rsync based backups to the former Hetzner Backupspace and then the current storagebox using [Autofs](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/setup-autofs-mount-storagebox), but never really liked that solution.   

I stumbled upon [Borg Backup](https://www.borgbackup.org) a while ago but never really liked the command line. I also tried borgmatic, but I am personally not to fond of having to have an extra virtual env for that. As I am using [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com) for almost anything anyways, why not use that.

Advantages of Borg:

* Fully encrypted
* Space saving due to linking and deduplication
* Reliable


**Prerequisites**

Besides having a Linux or FreeBSD server and a [Hetzner Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box), you will need to set up [SSH keys for the storage box](https://docs.hetzner.com/de/robot/storage-box/backup-space-ssh-keys/). If you backup multiple machines, you better use one host (a server or your Linux or MacOS based Computer) for running ansible on it. You should be able to log in using a ssh certificate with a user with sudo rights or as root from the ansible host to the servers to be backupped.  

This tutorial is based on Debian/Ubuntu. It should also work on SUSE or RedHat based distros, though the package names could differ.

For test and check purposes, it is very helpful mounting the storagebox on one host, e.g. using the above mentioned automounter.


## Ansible Setup ##

You can skip this chapter to Step 1 if you are already familiar with ansible. 

If you have never used ansible, you may start with some smaller howtos, like using ansible to install a webserver or create a user. I will cover the basic steps anyway.

You need to do the following steps on the management host, it will use ansible to connect to the managed host (the server which you want to have borg installed on)

### Ansible basics 

* What is ansible

Ansible is a tool which uses declarative structured (i.e. yu define, how you the managed system to be) configs and applies them to one or many managed servers. It only needs python installed on the managed system (almost always available on Linux and other unix like systems). Ansible consist 

* Modules

Ansible consists mainly of many modules, each of which can fulfill specific tasks, like installing packages, managing firewall etc. These modules are usually python scripts or similar, many are delivered together with ansible, many more can be downloaded from e.g. [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) or e.g. GitHub. Modules can also be written by yourself.

* Facts
Ansible can gather facts from the managed system, e.g. the used OS and version, diskspace, network settings etc. These facts can later be used for the configuration.
Facts can also be defined using variables for hosts etc.

* Tasks

A task in ansible is one step, calling a module for one single tasks, e.g. install a specific package.
Example:
```yaml
- name: Install the htop package
  package: 
    name: htop
    state: present
```
In this example, the ansible module "package" is used to install the package "htop".

* Roles

A Role is a set of files consisting of some tasks and files or templates which are applyed to the managed system

* Playbook

A playbook is a list of tasks and/or roles which are applyed to the managed hosts.


* Inventories

Ansible works on an inventory. The simplest inventory is a single host, but usually there is an inventory file with a list of hosts, often grouped and also with host spacific variables. 


* Modes

There are basically two modes: 

Ad hoc mode: Call ansible with the ansible command using one module on a defined inventory interactively on the shell. We use this mode later for basic tests.

Play mode: Call ansible with the ansible-playbook command applying many tasks/roles on the invetory.


### Install ansible

Use your package manager to install ansible, e.g. ```apt-get install ansible```

### Test if ansible can connect to the server to be managed

We use the ping module. This must not be confused with the ICMP ping command. The ansible ping module logs into the managed system using ansible and therefore checks if everything is set up correctly.

```bash
sysadmin@manager:~/ansible 2 $ ansible -i managed, -m ping all
[WARNING]: Platform linux on host docker is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python, but future installation of another Python interpreter
could change this. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.
docker | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
## What will happen

The Ansible role will do the following:

* create a sub-storagebox on the storagebox
* create a ssh key pair for the sub-storagebox and install the private key on the managed server
* Install borg backup on the managed server
* Install some bash scripts for borg on the managed host
* place a config file /etc/borg_backup.conf on the managed host with credentials for the sub storagebox and borg settings. This file is used by the bogr shellscripts
* Initialize a borg repo on the storagebox
* Install a cronjob for borg
* Write the borg key and ssh keypair in a folder on the manage host (keep these files in a safe place!)

The following scripts will be installed and conmfigured. They all rely on /etc/borg_backup.conf

* borg_init.sh
  * Initialize a repo. Already done by the ansible role
* borg_backup.sh
  * Create a backup. Used by the cronjob, can also be run manually
* borg_list.sh
  * List all backups
* borg_mount.sh MYBACKUP /mnt
  * Mount the Backup with the ID MYBACKUP (you get these by borg_list.sh) in /mnt
* borg_keyexport.sh
  * Export the borg secure key
* borg_info.sh MYBACKUP
  * Get Information about the specified Backup with the ID MYBACKUP. Get the ID from borg_list.sh

## Step 1 - Get the role 

Do this on the management host: 

Create a folder for ansible in your home and move to that folder:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/ansible/roles
$ cd ~/ansible/roles
```

Clone the role from githu into the roles folderb

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zapalotta/hetznerbackup.git
```

Copy the example inventory file and th eexample playbook to the ansible folder:

```bash
$ cp hosts.yml ~/ansible/
$ cp playbook.yml ~/ansible/hetznerbackup.yml
$ cd ~/ansible/
```

Create a config file for ansible:

```bash
$ cat << EOF > ~/ansible/ansible.cfg
[defaults]
roles_path = ~/ansible/roles 
EOF
```

## Step 2 - Prepare the inventory

Create a file called hosts.yml with the following content. This is YAML, so: indendation matters, and never use tabs!


```yaml
backuphosts:
  hosts:
    targethost
  vars:
    hetzner_webservice_user: "XXXXXXX"                               
    hetzner_webservice_pass: "XXXXXXX"
    hetzner_server_id: "123456"                                       
#    hetzner_storagebox_id: "98765"                                   
    hetznerbackup_master_user: uXXXXXXX                               
    hetznerbackup_master_storagebox: uXXXXXXX.your-backup.de          
    hetznerbackup_default_rsakey: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hetznerbackup         
    hetznerbackup_additional_include_dirs:                            
      - "/tmp"
    hetznerbackup_additional_exclude_dirs:                            
      - "/foo"
    hetznerbackup_cron_hour: 1                                        
    hetznerbackup_cron_minute: 0                                      

    hetznerbackup_keydir: /tmp/hetznerbackup_keys                     

```

* targethost
  * Managed host, where borg is to be installed
* hetzner_webservice_user
  * Webservice user for hetzner services. Get from hetzner robot -> Settings -> Webservice user
* hetzner_webservice_pass
  * Password for webservice user
* hetzner_server_id
  * Get from Hetzner Robot -> Server. e.g. EX41S #123456
* hetzner_storagebox_id
  * OPTIONAL: If you already have a dedicated sub storagebox for this backup, put it's ID here. Otherwise, one is created.
* hetznerbackup_master_user
  * User for the main storagebox
* hetznerbackup_master_storagebox
  * ID of the main storagebox
* hetznerbackup_default_rsakey
  * rsa key for the main storage box
* hetznerbackup_additional_include_dirs
  * OPTIONAL: List of folders to be additionally backuped. Defaults see github.
* hetznerbackup_additional_exclude_dirs
  * OPTIONAL: List of folders to be excluded from backup. Defaults see github.
* hetznerbackup_cron_hour
  * Hour on which the backup cronjob will be running
* hetznerbackup_cron_minute
  * Minute of the hour when the cronjob will be running
* hetznerbackup_keydir
  * Folder on the managER node (yor ansible host) where secrets for the backup will be written to

This example will set up all hosts mentioned in hosts: with the same settings (includes, excludes, cronjob). You can use [host variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-one-machine-host-variables) to configure multiple hosts with different settings



## Step 3 - Run Ansible 


```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml 
```

When ansible finishes without an error, your target server has been prepared for your first backup.

Please save the contents of the folder defined in hetznerbackup_keydir on the managed host as it contains the main key for the Bord Repo! When the backuped server crashed you will need this key for restore.

### Missing python libraries

It may happen that ansible is complaining about some missing python libraries on the management host. You can usually just install these by searching, the package names depend on your distro.

Example when ansible is complaining about a missing httplib: 

```bash
$ apt-cache search python | grep httplib
python3-httplib2 - comprehensive HTTP client library written for Python3

$ apt-get install python3-httplib2
```


## Step 4 - Check your installation

Do this on the managed server!

### Step 4.1 - Create your first backup

You can omit this step, the cronjob will create it automatically. Though I tend to do the first manually to see if it worked fine.

```bash
$ borg_backup.sh
###### Backup gestartet: Thu Apr 29 21:14:10 CEST 2021 ######

Thu Apr 29 21:14:10 CEST 2021 ###### Backup gestartet: Thu Apr 29 21:14:10 CEST 2021 ######

### Step 4.2 - Get a list of all backups created. 

```bash
$ borg_list.sh
2021-02-28_23:00                     Sun, 2021-02-28 23:00:05

```

This is a list from a server which has run the backups for a while obviously.


### Step 4.3 - Get data from a backup

Mount the backup anywhere and copy files. 

```bash
$ borg_mount.sh 2021-04-29_01:00 /mnt
$ cp /mnt/home/myself/afile.txt /home/myself/restored.txt
```




## Conclusion

By following this tutorial you have now set up automatic, encrypted, secure backup of a server to a Hetzner Storage Box.
