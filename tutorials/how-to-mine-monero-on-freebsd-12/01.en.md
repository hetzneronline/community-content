## Introduction

Monero is a cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin, but unlike Bitcoin it is possible to actually mine more then a negligible amount using just a standard CPU or GPU. This tutorial will only be focusing on CPU mining because it is directed at servers -- many of which do not have a GPU.

This tutorial will show you how to install the Monero miner `xmrig` on FreeBSD 12 and mine Monero with a mining pool that will get paid into your Monero wallet.

* It is assumed that you are running as the `root` user during this guide. Use `su` to change to `root` if you are not running as `root` already.

**Prerequisites**

* A FreeBSD 12 **dedicated** server with root access. On almost all Cloud or VPS (Virtual Private Servers) mining is **not allowed and/or is heavily discouraged**. Please double check your hosting provider's policies before mining.
* A Monero wallet that mined cryptocurrency can go into. The Monero project provides a GUI wallet that you can use at [getmonero.org](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/).

## Step 1 - Updating FreeBSD

*By default, FreeBSD does not come with the `pkg` package manager, but comes with a tool to bootstrap it. If FreeBSD asks to install it, answer 'Yes'.*

It would be a good idea to update the system beforehand to ensure you are getting the latest packages when installing `xmrig` -- as old versions may not be able to mine Monero properly. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pkg update ; pkg upgrade
```

This will update the repositories of `pkg`, and then upgrade any installed packages that you may have.

## Step 2 - Installing xmrig

`xmrig` can be installed by using the `pkg` tool that may have been installed in the previous step. To do so, run the following command:

```
pkg install xmrig
```

* To configure it to start automatically on boot, run the following command:

```
echo 'xmrig_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
```

## Step 3 - Configuring xmrig

Although `xmrig` is now installed -- and setup to start on boot, we need to configure the mining pool that our server will mine to.

While solo mining is theoretically possible with only one computer, unless you have an extremely powerful computer or set of computers it is quite unlikely you will be able to mine anything at all. Because of this, you will be mining as part of a collective of other Monero miners called a "mining pool", where mined cryptocurrency is split depending on how much work your computer did.

This tutorial will focus on using the [supportxmr.com mining pool](https://supportxmr.com/), (though [other pools are available as well](https://monero.org/services/mining-pools/)), as it is one of the more popular mining pools and has a relatively low pool fee of 0.6%.

Before we can use xmrig for mining, we need to configure it with information such as the mining pool and the wallet address you will be using:

```
vi /usr/local/etc/xmrig/config.json
```

The relevant lines we need to edit are between `donate-level` and `print-time`. This is what it should look like before editing:

```
    "donate-level": 5,
    "donate-over-proxy": 1,
    "log-file": null,
    "pools": [
        {
            "algo": null,
            "coin": null,
            "url": "donate.v2.xmrig.com:3333",
            "user": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
            "pass": "x",
            "rig-id": null,
            "nicehash": false,
            "keepalive": false,
            "enabled": true,
            "tls": false,
            "tls-fingerprint": null,
            "daemon": false,
            "self-select": null
        }
    ],
    "print-time": 60,
```

We need to make the following changes to this configuration file:

* Change `log-file` to `"/var/log/xmrig.log"`
* Change `url` to the mining pool URL that you are using.
* Change `user` to the address of the Monero wallet you are using.
* Change `pass` to the worker name you want on your pool's website. Useful if you have multiple miners on the same pool with the same wallet address. (Optional)
* Change `donate-level` to `0`. (Optional -- donate-level by default is 5%, meaning that 5% of of your total mining will go toward xmrig's author.)

Some pools may also require you to enable `tls`. Usually this isn't required.

It should now look something like this:

```
    "donate-level": 0,
    "donate-over-proxy": 1,
    "log-file": "/var/log/xmrig.log",
    "pools": [
        {
            "algo": null,
            "coin": null,
            "url": "pool.supportxmr.com:5555",
            "user": "46wMHYi7ukCCe31U18DAgSbHuTRgizfxrdpRDUSuap2Abu9EiPrYMZ2ARQaH2pYHmEMX4Yd4u5VcKWaNkQf1MPXXFXq1WQc",
            "pass": "x",
            "rig-id": null,
            "nicehash": false,
            "keepalive": false,
            "enabled": true,
            "tls": false,
            "tls-fingerprint": null,
            "daemon": false,
            "self-select": null
        }
    ],
    "print-time": 60,
```

To create the logfile you specified in the configuration and giving the `xmrig` user permission to write to it:

```
touch /var/log/xmrig.log ; chown xmrig /var/log/xmrig.log
```

Before starting `xmrig` as a service, we should first check that your configuration is setup properly. To do so, run the following command:

```
xmrig
```

It should look something like this (only part of the log is shown):

```
 * ABOUT        XMRig/5.5.0 clang/8.0.1
 * LIBS         libuv/1.34.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1d-freebsd hwloc/1.11.11

```

## Step 4 - Mining

Now you can start the mining service so that mining can happen without you needing to be logged into your server.

```
service xmrig start
```

Finally, check that xmrig is logging to your logfile correctly:

```
ls -l /var/log/xmrig.log
```

You should get something like this, with a file size greater then 0 meaning that it is logging:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 xmrig  wheel  5100 Jan  1 00:10 xmrig.log
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You should now have a working Monero miner on FreeBSD 12 using `xmrig` that will automatically payout to your wallet address when you have mined more than 0.1 XMR. You can use the same mining pool and address with different miners if you wish.

* Tools like [cryptocompare.com](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr) can be used to estimate how much Monero you will earn over time, and the current exchange rate between Monero and USD.
* xmrig will log its output to `/var/log/xmrig.log` so you can see the status of your miner.
* You can also check the status of your miner by going to your mining pool's website and putting your wallet address into it.
* The default configuration of xmrig will be using 100% of your CPU by default and will not be using your GPU (if you have one). Further information about configuring xmrig including information about changing these defaults can be found at [xmrig.com](https://xmrig.com/docs).
