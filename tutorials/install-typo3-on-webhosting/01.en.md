* Confirm database creation (add)
* Keep the browser-tab open to enter the login credentials later.


## Step 3 - Installing TYPO3
* **3.1** Downloading
  After the SSH connection hsa been established, the files can be downloaded. To do this, use the Curl-Command from https://get.typo3.org/version (Download via wget/curl) for the current version. Here's an example:
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ curl -L -o typo3_src.tgz https://get.typo3.org/<aktuelle version>
  ```
  
* **3.2** Unpacking
  After the `tar.gz`-Archive has been downloaded, it can be unpacked using this command:
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ tar -xf typo3_src.tgz
  ```
  There should now be a `typo_src`-Folder in your current directory.

* **3.3** Moving the files
  The `typo_src`-Folder can now be moved into the `public_html` directory.
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ mv typo3_src-* ~/public_html/typo
  ```
  After that, you can switch to the new directory:
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ cd ~/public_html/typo
  ```
    
* **3.4** To start the installation, you first have to initialize the package management tool:
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ composer install
  ```
    
* **3.5** After that, the setup-tool can be used as follows.
  ```bash
  typot@<wwwXXX>:~$ ./bin/typo3 setup
  ```
  You'll have to answer some questions for the setup:
  * Webserver: `apache`
  * Database Driver: `pdoMysql`
  * Database username: from konsoleH (e.g. `typot_1`)
  * Database password: from konsoleH (will not be displayed when writing, just press enter after pasting it)
  * Database port: default (just keep it empty, enter)
  * Database host: from konsoleH (e.g. `xxxx.your-database.de`)
  * Database to use: first (and only) Option; like konsoleH
  * Admin-Nutzername: Choose yourself
  * Admin-Passwort: Choose a safe password
  * Admin-Email: Your E-Mail
  * Create Basic Page?: URL (e.g. `http://typo.example.com/`) or keep empty

## Step 4 - Changing the webroot
* Open [konsoleH](https://konsoleh.hetzner.com/) again
* Go to `Settings` > `Server Configuration`
* Select the directory `typo` beneath `public_html`.
* Click on "Change document root"
