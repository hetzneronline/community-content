## Introduction

This tutorial will give you a short introduction into borgmatic and how to create an full system backup of your server onto your Hetzner Storage Box.

Borgmatic is a simple tool which simplifies the use of BorgBackup and extends it with some more features.

The official documentation is available at the [borgmatic website](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/).

**Prerequisites**

 * A linux server you want to backup
 * A StorageBox with enough free space and set up SSH-Keys.

A tutorial on how to setup SSH-Keys for your Storage Box can be found in the [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box/backup-space-ssh-keys).

## Step 1 - Install and configure borgmatic

In this step we will cover how to install and configure borgmatic.

### Step 1.1  Install BorgBackup and borgmatic

Borgmatic does not automatically include BorgBackup, so we have to install both packages manually:

```shell
apt update && apt install borgbackup borgmatic
```

### Step 1.2 - Configuration of borgmatic

An example configuration can be generated with

```shell
borgmatic config generate
```

This will generate a configuration with example values at `/etc/borgmatic/config.yaml`.

A full list of available configuration parameters can be found in the official [configuration reference](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/).

For this tutorial you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
# A list of all directoy which should be included within the backup.
# As we want to create a full system backup "/" is sufficient.
source_directories:
    - /

# Here you can specify a list of Storage Boxes as backup target and optional labels
repositories:
    - path: ssh://u123456@u123456.your-storagebox.de/./backups
      label: storagebox

#  Exclude the default mount directory and any directories which are created at runtime.
exclude_patterns:
    - /dev
    - /proc
    - /sys
    - /var/run
    - /run
    - /mnt
    - /tmp

# Here you can specify the password which is used to encrypt your backups. This is _not_ your Storage Box password.
# Do not lose this. Otherwise you are not able to restore your backup later.
encryption_passphrase: "<SUPER SECRET PASSWORD>"

# As BorgBackup is running on port 23 on the Storage Boxes, we have to overwrite the default ssh command in order to specify a port.
ssh_command: ssh -p 23

# Here you can specify how many backups should be kept at minimum for the specified time frame.
keep_daily: 7
keep_weekly: 4
keep_monthly: 6
keep_yearly: 1
```

### Step 1.3 - Initializing and creating our first backup

Before we can create our first backup, we have to initialize our backup repository first.

```shell
borgmatic init --encryption repokey --verbosity 1
```

After the successful initialization we can create our first backup.

```shell
borgmatic --verbosity 1
```

The first backup may take a while, depending on the size of your Server.
Future backups will be faster as they are only incremental.

## Step 2 - Automatization

Use `systemctl status borgmatic.timer borgmatic.service` to check if the service and the timer already exist.

- If you get an error like `Unit borgmatic.XXX could not be found`, you can follow the instructions below.
- If the units are found and you can see their status, you can <u>skip</u> this step.

-------

For the automatization we will use a systemd unit and timer.
Copy the following part, which starts the backup, to `/etc/systemd/system/borgmatic.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Borgmatic system backup
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Nice=10
IOSchedulingClass=best-effort
IOSchedulingPriority=6
ProtectSystem=full
ExecStart=/usr/bin/borgmatic --verbosity -1 --syslog-verbosity 1
```

The following part is responsible for the regular start of the backup.
Copy it to `/etc/systemd/system/borgmatic.timer`.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Daily backup timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 16:30:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Now we just have to enable the timer:

```shell
systemctl enable --now borgmatic.timer
```

The timer will start a backup, everyday at 16:30.

## Conclusion

With Borgmatic we have a simple, yet powerful tool which allows us to create backups of our systems.
We have configured it and set up automatic backups in order to protect against data loss.
