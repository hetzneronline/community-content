## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) on top of a fresh kubernetes cluster. With help of a simple nginx service different solutions will be shown on how to serve the page with a self-signed certificate, a let's encrypt staging and production certificate. All certificate stuff is done with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).

You should be familiar with basic kubernetes usage and have a working k8s cluster on hand. If you do not have a cluster yet, simply build your own in a few minutes following [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-kubernetes-cluster).

**Prerequisites**

* A working kubernetes cluster (build your own with [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-kubernetes-cluster))
* A floating IP pointing to your cluster or the public IP of one of your nodes (`<10.0.0.1>` in this tutorial; the `<>` are not part of the IP)
* Familiarity with linux and working on the shell
* `kubectl` command line tool installed
* An email address for usage with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), this tutorial uses: `mail@example.com`

**Recommended**

* Familiarity with the [concepts of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)
* A valid domain or subdomain, with access to DNS setup.

*This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 Hetzner Cloud server and Kubernetes version v1.15.7 and v1.16.4, Ubuntu 18.04 was used as local machine.

All steps can be executed as is on the machine where `kubectl` is installed. Most steps are using heredoc notation to prevent config file creation. The used kubernetes services will use different syntax, where possible. This shall show you different possibilities.

## Step 1 - Deploy Traefik as ingress controller

The following setup is based on the [official setup instructions](https://docs.traefik.io/v1.7/user-guide/kubernetes/).

### Step 1.1 - Create the required RBAC roles

Traefik needs some kubernetes roles configured, before the setup of the service can be done.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-rbac.yaml
```

### Step 1.2 - Setup Traefik

As stated in the docs, traefik can be installed as `Controller` or a `DaemonSet`. In this tutorial we use the `DaemonSet` deployment. If you have a cluster consisting of multiple nodes (master or workers), exactly one traefik pod will be created on every node without additional configuration.

!!! If you just have a single node cluster, take care to taint the master node to accept pods: `kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-`

You can define the traefik configuration with cli flags or using a toml file. The toml file is easier to handle for complex setups. Due to simplicity, cli flags are used in this tutorial.

!!! The config uses the `type` `LoadBalancer` instead of `NodePort`. This should work for bare metall setups with `metallb` like in [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-kubernetes-cluster). If you're using a cloud provider with an external load balancer, you might use `NodePort` instead.

!!! The used traefik configuration is not production ready! You should use http basic auth to secure the dashboard in combination with automatic https redirection. For a production environment it's also recommended to setup traefik into a seperate namespace.

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -

        args:
        - --api
        - --accesslog
        - --logLevel=INFO
        - --kubernetes
        - --defaultentrypoints=http,https
        - --entrypoints=Name:https Address::443 TLS
        - --entrypoints=Name:http Address::80
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: traefik-ingress-service
  namespace: kube-system

      name: https
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      name: dashboard
  type: LoadBalancer
EOF
```

The above config publishes the Traefik dashboard on port `8080` and publishes the default ports used for HTTP traffic: `80` and `443`.

### Step 1.3 - Validate setup

Check if all pods are `Running`.

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pod
```

```bash
# Output:
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-5d4dd4b4db-frkpb           1/1     Running   0          12m
coredns-5d4dd4b4db-t8z2s           1/1     Running   0          12m
etcd-k1                            1/1     Running   1          11m
kube-apiserver-k1                  1/1     Running   1          6m49s
kube-controller-manager-k1         1/1     Running   1          11m
kube-flannel-ds-amd64-hbk58        1/1     Running   0          5m47s
kube-proxy-dmng9                   1/1     Running   1          12m
kube-scheduler-k1                  1/1     Running   1          12m
traefik-ingress-controller-z8xdn   1/1     Running   0          36s
```

Get the `EXTERNAL-IP` assigned to the `traefik-ingress-service`.

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get service
```

```bash
# Output:
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                    AGE
kube-dns                  ClusterIP      10.96.0.10     <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP                                     16m
traefik-ingress-service   LoadBalancer   10.109.23.93   10.0.0.1    80:31681/TCP,443:31856/TCP,8080:32684/TCP                  4m23s
```

You can also show the logs for the traefik pod using its given label.

* logs for a specific pod

  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system logs -f $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=traefik-ingress-lb  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
  ```

* logs for all pods, useful if you have multiple nodes

  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system logs -f -l k8s-app=traefik-ingress-lb
  ```

### Step 1.4 - Open Traefik dashboard

The `Service` you created, should have got the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the server. This should be the same as our floating IP or the public IP of the server, depending on your setup. A `LoadBalancer` service binds to some random port(s) as you see in column `PORT(S)`. Knowing the port and the IP is all you need to open the Dashboard (`http://<10.0.0.1>:32684`).

## Step 2 - Host a simple nginx service

In the next step we will deploy a simple nginx service and will publish it on your domain.

### Step 2.1 - Prepare the domain

If you have your own domain (in this tutorial: `<example.com>`), take care to create an `A-Record` in the DNS settings to your cluster's floating IP (`<10.0.0.1>`) or the server's public IP. Depending on your provider's TTL (Time to Live in seconds) it can take some time, that the DNS changes are propagated. Because your local system DNS will not update as frequently as the server settings, it's also a good idea to do the check on the server.

You can check if your domain points to the right IP with:

```bash
host <example.com>
```

```bash
# Outputs:
example.com has address 10.0.0.1
```

Store your domain as environmental variable for further usage:

```bash
DOMAIN=<example.com>
```

### Step 2.2 - Deploy nginx service

We will now use the configured `DOMAIN` directly inside the config. As you can see, the service will be created in a seperate namespace. This is the recommended way.

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: testing
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes
status:
  phase: Active
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: "PathPrefixStrip"
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing
spec:
  rules:
  - host: ${DOMAIN}
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: nginx
          servicePort: 80
EOF
```

Check that the nginx pod is created and `Running`.

```bash
kubectl -n testing get pod
```

```bash
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-74f6bc9c7c-bvjh5   1/1     Running   0          9s
```

After applying the changes, open `<example.com>` in your browser. You should see a very basic html page now.

If you open the pods log and reload the domain in the browser, you'll see the requests in the nginx logs.

```bash
kubectl -n testing logs -f $(kubectl -n testing get pods -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

## Step 3 - Deploy HTTPS

For a production ready page, you should always use https (HTTP over TLS = encrypted http) for security reasons! In days of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) this is a very easy task. No complicated certificate handling anymore.

Traefik can use Let's Encrypt on it's own, but this is not the recommended way and might fail in some cases. A much better way (in the sense of `do-one-thing-and-to-it-right`) is the usage of `cert-manager`.

### Step 3.1 - Setup cert-manager

* Official docs: https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/

```bash
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

After a few seconds all pods should be in `RUNNING` state.

!!! The `watch` command is not a special kubernetes command. It's simply a standard unix command that executes the following command every second.

```bash
watch kubectl -n cert-manager get pods
```

```bash
#Outputs:
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-66c8bc8b67-5qcb4             1/1     Running   0          24s
cert-manager-cainjector-df4dc78cd-s56zv   1/1     Running   0          24s
cert-manager-webhook-5f78ff89bc-hr9ck     1/1     Running   0          24s
```

`cert-manager` is now ready to use. In the next steps we will tryout different ways to create testing and production ready certificates.

### Step 3.2 - Create self-signed certificate

For some use cases, e.g. internal or test usage, you can easily create a self-signed certificate with `cert-manager`. To configure a certificate with `cert-manager` you always need an `Issuer`, `ClusterIssuer` and the `Certificate` ressource.

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned
  namespace: testing
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: ${DOMAIN}-cert
  namespace: testing
spec:
  commonName: ${DOMAIN}
  secretName: ${DOMAIN}-cert
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned
EOF
```

You can check the status of the `Certificate` very easily.

* short status

  ```bash
  kubectl -n testing get certificate
  ```

  ```bash
  # Outputs:
  10.0.0.1.example.com-cert   True    10.0.0.1.example.com-cert   47s
  ```

* full info and status

  ```bash
  kubectl -n testing describe certificate <10.0.0.1>.example.com-cert
  ```

  ```bash
  # Outputs:
  ...
  Events:
    Type    Reason        Age   From          Message
    ----    ------        ----  ----          -------
    Normal  GeneratedKey  94s   cert-manager  Generated a new private key
    Normal  Requested     94s   cert-manager  Created new CertificateRequest resource "10.0.0.1.example.com-cert-2241091300"
    Normal  Issued        94s   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
  ```

Our nginx service doesn't know about the certificate right now. Reconfigure the `Ingress` to change this.

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: "PathPrefixStrip"
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing
spec:
  rules:
  - host: ${DOMAIN}
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: nginx
          servicePort: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - ${DOMAIN}
    secretName: ${DOMAIN}-cert
EOF
```

If you open `https://<example.com>` in your browser, you have to accept the certificate first. That's because your certificate is not signed by an official, trusted Certificate Authority (CA). After adding the exception, you should see the default nginx page, but secured by `https`.

### Step 3.3 - Create a staging certificate

"Let's Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority run by Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) that provides X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption at no charge. The certificate is valid for 90 days, during which renewal can take place at any time. The offer is accompanied by an automated process designed to overcome manual creation, validation, signing, installation, and renewal of certificates for secure websites." ([Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt))

The process behind Let`s Encrypt is very easy:

* check if the requested domain points to the same IP the request comes from
* check for some special files on the pointing server
* if one of the conditions is not met, refuse the request

A staging certificate is for testing purposes only and has to be accepted manually like a self-signed certificate. Take care, that your domain is configured properly! Please replace the email with a proper mail address!

#### Issuer

To get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, you need to setup an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`. A `Issuer` is valid for the current namespace, a `ClusterIssuer` does not depend on the namespace.

```bash
# Please replace mail with your mail
YOUR_MAIL_ADDRESS=mail@example.com

cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email: ${YOUR_MAIL_ADDRESS}
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: staging-issuer-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01 using nginx
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: traefik
EOF
```

Get the status with `describe` or simple status with `get`.

```bash
# check status
kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt-staging
```

```bash
# Outputs:
Status:
  Acme:
    Last Registered Email:  mail@example.com
    Uri:                    https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/12082973
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2020-01-13T15:40:13Z
    Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
    Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:                    <none>
```

#### Certificate

Take care to configure your domain properly like described in `Step 2`.

The certificates content is stored in a secret. To create a new certificate, we have to delete this secret. Also delete the certificate, otherwise `cert-manager` will create a new one instantly. You have to add a label to your nginx ingress `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-staging`. Otherwise `cert-manager` does not know which issuer to use.

```bash
kubectl -n testing delete certificate "${DOMAIN}-cert"
kubectl -n testing delete secret "${DOMAIN}-cert"
```

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: "PathPrefixStrip"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-staging
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing
spec:
  rules:
  - host: ${DOMAIN}
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: nginx
          servicePort: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - ${DOMAIN}
    secretName: ${DOMAIN}-cert
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: ${DOMAIN}-cert
  namespace: testing
spec:
  commonName: ${DOMAIN}
  secretName: ${DOMAIN}-cert
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
EOF
```

The request takes about 30 seconds. You can check the status continuously with the bash command `watch`.

```bash
watch kubectl -n testing describe certificate "${DOMAIN}-cert"
```

```bash
# Output
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2020-01-13T16:06:33Z
    Message:               Certificate is up to date and has not expired
    Reason:                Ready
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
  Not After:               2020-04-12T15:06:33Z
Events:
  Type    Reason        Age    From          Message
  ----    ------        ----   ----          -------

  Normal  Requested     2m26s  cert-manager  Created new CertificateRequest resource "10.0.0.1.xip.io-cert-4183194560"
  Normal  Issued        2m     cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
```

`cert-manager` outputs lots of stuff during this operation. If something goes wrong (e.g. no certificate after a minute or two), you can check the logs with:

* static log

  ```bash
  kubectl -n cert-manager logs $(kubectl -n cert-manager get pod -l app=cert-manager -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
  ```

* live log

  ```bash
  kubectl -n cert-manager logs -f --tail 20 $(kubectl -n cert-manager get pod -l app=cert-manager -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
  ```

#### Open in browser

If you open or reload `https://example.com` or `https://$DOMAIN` in your browser, the certificate will not be trusted, comparable to the self-signed certificate. The name differs now is the name of the issuer `Fake LE Intermediate X1` instead of `cert-manager`.

### Step 3.4 - Create a production certificate

If everything worked well in the last steps, you can continue to obtain a production ready Let's Encrypt certificate. A production certificate is signed by an official CA and will be trusted out of the box by all mainstream browsers (e.g. Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, IE, Edge, Safari, Opera). The resulting certificate is valid for 90 days. cert-manager renews the certificates every 30 days on its own, doing so the certificate should never expire.

!!! To force a renewal, simply delete the secret containing the certificate: `kubectl -n testing delete secret "${DOMAIN}-cert"`.

If you are using your own domain, the process should work.

#### Issuer

```bash
YOUR_MAIL_ADDRESS=mail@example.com

cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email: ${YOUR_MAIL_ADDRESS}
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: letsencrypt-issuer-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01 using nginx
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: traefik
EOF
```

Check status

```bash
kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt
```

```bash
# Outputs:

#### Certificate

Again, drop the `Certificate` and the corresponding `Secret`.

```bash
kubectl -n testing delete certificate "${DOMAIN}-cert"
kubectl -n testing delete secret "${DOMAIN}-cert"
```

```bash

DOMAIN=example.com

cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik

    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
  name: nginx
  namespace: testing

  rules:

        backend:

metadata:
  name: ${DOMAIN}-cert
  namespace: testing
spec:

  secretName: ${DOMAIN}-cert

EOF
```

Again, check the status of the request and check the logs of cert-manager after a minute if the certificate doesn't show `Status: True`.

```bash
watch kubectl -n testing describe certificate "${DOMAIN}-cert"
```

```bash

```

## Conclusion

This tutorial has shown you how to setup traefik as ingress controller on a plain kubernetes cluster. Additionally you should be able to secure a deployed webservice with a self-signed TLS certificate or one from Let's Encrypt.

!!! The used traefik configuration is not production ready! You should use (at least) http basic auth to secure the dashboard in combination with automatic https redirection.
