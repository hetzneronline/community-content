## Prerequisites
1. Hetzner Account
1. Control of a publicly resolvable domain
1. SMTP Server (can be any free webmail service if you don't have your own server)

## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Vaultwarden via a Docker image.

Vaultwarden is an alternative implementation of the Bitwarden serverside which itself is not completely open-source and hides features behind a pay-wall.
The Vaultwarden project, maintained by dani-garcia, mimics the client interfaces to be almost fully compatible with the broad range of Bitwarden clients.

**DANGER ZONE - READ CAREFULLY**

> The vaultwarden serverside does (when properly configured) not store sensitive data in plain text at any give point in time. The decryption of the users data happens only on the endpoint either
in an app, browser extension or inside the web application. Make sure you're comfortable with these security parameters before storing critical data and passwords.

> IF YOU LOOSE A USERS MASTER KEY, ALL THEIR DATA IS LOST - FOREVER. Enabling existing work arounds for this issue undermines many, if not all, security benefits of the applications design.

## What will be achieved

* Install and set up Docker.

* Configure Traefik, ModSecurity and Vaultwarden

* Profit

## Step 1 - Setup new Server

Do not host Vaultwarden and other applications on the same host if not absolutely required. 
The attack surface should be as small as possible and any added complexity from other applications will introduce unnecessary uncertainty.

1. Open Hetzner [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
1. Click "New Project +" and create a new project
1. Click "Add Server" and select a datacenter which is closest to your users
1. Select Debian 11 as OS
1. Depending on the amount of users select at least a CPX21 instance
2. ```
1. Go to "SSH keys" and paste your SSH key. On Windows 10 you can get it via powershell `cat $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
1. Go to "Cloud config" and insert the code below
1. Name the server appropriately and click "Create & Buy now"

```yml
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
apt:
  sources:
    docker.list:
      source: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $RELEASE stable
      keyid: 9DC858229FC7DD38854AE2D88D81803C0EBFCD88

packages:
  - apt-transport-https
  - ca-certificates
  - curl
  - gnupg-agent
  - software-properties-common
  - docker-ce
  - docker-ce-cli
  - containerd.io
  - fail2ban
  
groups:
  - docker
  
system_info:
  default_user:
    groups: [docker]

```
[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62540068)

This `cloud-init` script will take care of the docker installation, so its a controlled process which is less prone to error.

## Step 2 - Set DNS Records
Setting the DNS records now gives the DNS system enough time to propagate the changes far enough so that the Let's Encrypt resolvers will resolve the hostname to your IP.
This is necessary to obtain a valid SSL certificate to encrypt client connections and proof authenticity of our host system.

Go to the admin panel of the company that hosts your domain name and create an A record with the subdomain of your choosing and the IPv4 address of the newly created server.


## Step 3 - Setup the docker-compose.yml file

Opinions on this matter may differ but you could place your `docker-compose.yml` file virtually anywhere. We will use the `/opt` directory.

- Create a folder called `vaultwarden` in `/opt`
  ```bash
  mkdir /opt/vaultwarden && cd /opt/vaultwarden
```

- Create necessary files
  ```bash
  mkdir /opt/docker && mkdir /opt/docker/waf-rules
  touch /opt/docker/waf-rules/REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS.conf
  touch /opt/docker/waf-rules/RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS.conf
  mkdir /opt/docker/le && chmod -R 600 /opt/docker/le
```

-  Add a `docker-compose.yml` file
  ```bash
  nano docker-compose.yml
```

  Copy & paste the code below to the new `docker-compose.yml` file and edit the following placeholders:
   
  | Placeholder        | Description |
  | ------------------ | ----------- |
  | `your@domain.tld`  | Put an e-mail you regulary read (SSL notifications will be send there) |
  | `sub.domain.tld`   | This occurs four times so make sure to change all instances. Change to your domain name like vault.yourdomain.tld |
  | `domain host name` | Enter the hostname of your SMTP server (Google smtp settings [your mail provider] |
  | `sender email e.g: your@domain.tld` | Change to the email you wish to send notifications from |
  | `sender name`      | Replace with Vaultwarden or something to instantly tell this e-mail is from the password server |
  | `smtp username`    | In most cases your e-mail address except on AWS SES where you would need to create extra IAM users |
  | `smtp password`    | Your smtp password |
  | `Europe/Berlin`    | If you don't live in the GTM+1 Timezone change this |

Edit the following placeholder texts:

1. `you@domain.tld` <- Put an e-mail you regulary read (SSL notifications will be send there)

1. `sub.domain.tld` <- This occurs four times so make sure to change all instances. Change to your domain name like vault.yourdomain.tld

1. `domain host name` <- Enter the hostname of your SMTP server (Google smtp settings [your mail provider]

1. `sender email e.g: you@domain.tld` <- Change to the email you wish to send notifications from

1. `sender name` <- Replace with Vaultwarden or something to instantly tell this e-mail is from the password server

1. `smtp username` <- In most cases your e-mail address except on AWS SES where you would need to create extra IAM users

1. `smtp-password` <- Your smtp password

1. `Europe/Berlin` <- If you don't live in the GTM+1 Timezone change this

- Put nano editor in background with `CTRL` + `Z`

- Generate Admin token and copy output
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 48
```

- Bring nano back to front: type `fg` and press `ENTER`

- Replace `ADMINTOKEN-REPLACE` with the copied output of the previous command

- Save file with `CTRL`+`X` and then press `Y` and `ENTER`

## Step 4 - Configure Fail2Ban
Create filter for the vaultwarden application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/vaultwarden.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[INCLUDES]
before = common.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Username or password is incorrect\. Try again\. IP: <ADDR>\. Username:.*$
ignoreregex =
```
[Source](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Fail2Ban-Setup)


Create filter for the vaultwarden admin application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/vaultwarden-admin.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[INCLUDES]
before = common.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Invalid admin token\. IP: <ADDR>.*$
ignoreregex =
```
[Source](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Fail2Ban-Setup)


Create filter for the ModSecurity application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/waf.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[INCLUDES]
before = common.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*\[client <ADDR>\] ModSecurity: Access denied with code 403 .*$
ignoreregex =
```

Create jail for the vaultwarden application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/vaultwarden.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[vaultwarden]
enabled = true
port = 80,443,8081
filter = vaultwarden
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
logpath = /path/to/vaultwarden.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 14400
findtime = 14400
```
[Source](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Fail2Ban-Setup)


Create jail for the vaultwarden admin application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/vaultwarden-admin.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[vaultwarden-admin]
enabled = true
port = 80,443
filter = vaultwarden-admin
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
logpath = /path/to/vaultwarden.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 14400
findtime = 14400
```
[Source](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Fail2Ban-Setup)


Create jail for the ModSecurity application
```bash
nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/waf.local
```

Include the following lines
```yml
[waf]
enabled = true
port = 80,443
filter = waf
action = iptables-allports[name=waf, chain=FORWARD]
logpath = /opt/docker/waf/waf.log
maxretry = 1
bantime = 14400
findtime = 14400
```

Reload the ruleset with `sudo systemctl reload fail2ban`


## Step 5 - Starting Instance

To startup your instance, run:
```bash
cd /opt/vaultwarden && docker compose up -d
```

Traefik needs some time to properly start up, discover all services and issue certificates. This can take up to 5 minutes so please be a little patient.
You can check the logs for errors with `docker compose logs`.

You can now connect to your Vaultwarden instance via any modern web browser by accessing https://your.domain.tld and create an account for yourself.
To access the admin interface go to https://your.domain.tld/admin and enter the code generated with OpenSSL earlier on. You can look it up with the command:
```bash
grep ADMIN_TOKEN /opt/vaultwarden/docker-compose.yml
```

There you can manipulate all important settings, however the configuration defined in the docker-compose.yml is a good starting point. You might want to disable public registration though.
Just go to `General Settings` and uncheck `Allow new singups` and press save on the bottom of the page.


### How to connect through Bitwarden applications

To connect your devices to your new Vaultwarden server, please follow [this guide from Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/help/change-client-environment/).

## Step 6 - Optional: Tuning ModSecurity

ModSecurity is a web application firewall that can prevent common attacks on web applications such as Vaultwarden. Depending on the protection requirements, it might be necessary to increase
the aggressivity of ModSecurity. In order to do so, increase `PARANOIA` or decrease `ANOMALY_INBOUND` in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Be warned, changes to the default values will require manual tuning of ModSecurity
which will take quite some time to get just right. There is a good guide [here](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/false_positives_tuning/)

## Step 7 - Enable Hetzner Firewall
1. Open [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/), select your project, go to `Firewall` and click on `Create Firewall`.
1. Add three _inbound_ rules to the Firewall:
   
   -------------------
   
   **First rule**<br>
   Protocol: TCP<br>
   Port: 80<br>
   IP: `Any IPv4`, `Any IPv6`
  
   -------------------
   
   **Second rule**<br>
   Protocol: TCP<br>
   Port: 443<br>
   IP: `Any IPv4`, `Any IPv6`
   
   -------------------
   
   **Third rule**<br>
   Protocol: TCP<br>
   Port: 22<br>
   IP: `<your-own-IP>`<br><br>
   If you don't know your IP address, you can go to https://ip.hetzner.com/ and copy and paste it from there.
   <br>
   > ** Note: ** Residential internet connections will most likely change their public IPv4 address frequently or might even be behind CGNAT. This means you need to change the third firewall rule any time you want to access your server to reflect your current IPv4 address.
   
   ------------------- 
   
1. Apply the Firewall to your server.
   - Go to `Apply to` and select `+ SELECT RESOURCES` ➔  `Server`.
   - Select you server and click on `APPLY TO 1 SERVER`.
1. Click `Create Firewall`
1. Open your project inside the Hetzner Cloud console

1. Go to `Firewall`

1. Click `Create Firewall`

1. Change the prefilled port 22 to 80 and keep protocol as TCP for the first rule

1. Change the protocol of the second rule also to TCP and change the port to 443

1. Click `Add Rule` -> `Inbound`

1. Go to `https://www.myip.com/` and copy your IP

1. Delete `Any IPv6` and `Any IPv4` from the third rule and paste your IP instead

1. Select Protocol TCP and Port 22

1. Select `Apply to` -> `Servers` -> `Select your sever` -> `Apply to 1 server`

1. Click `Create Firewall`


** Note **
Residential internet connections will moste likely change their public IPv4 address frequently or might even be behind CGNAT. This means you need to change the third
firewall rule any time you want to access your server to reflect your current IPv4 address.
