## Introduction

ControlPanel’s Dashboard is a dashboard application that allows you to manage your Pterodactyl servers and offer a credit-based billing solution to your clients. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install ControlPanel’s Dashboard on a Hetzner Cloud server running Ubuntu 22.04.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

-A Hetzner Cloud account and a project
-A Hetzner Cloud server with at least 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of disk space
-A domain name that points to your server’s IP address
-A valid SSL certificate for your domain name (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Install dependencies

The first step is to install the dependencies that are required for ControlPanel’s Dashboard. These include PHP 8.1, MySQL, Redis, NGINX, and Composer.

To install these dependencies, log in to your server via SSH and run the following commands:

```bash
# Add "add-apt-repository" command
apt -y install software-properties-common curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg

# Add additional repositories for PHP, Redis, and MariaDB (for Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04)
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php
curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash

# Update repositories list
apt update

# Add universe repository if you are on Ubuntu 18.04
apt-add-repository universe

# Install Dependencies 
apt -y install php8.1 php8.1-{cli,gd,mysql,pdo,mbstring,tokenizer,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip} mariadb-server nginx tar unzip git redis-server

# Install extra dependency for handling currencies
apt -y install php8.1-intl

# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

```
## Step 2: Download files

The next step is to create a folder where the dashboard files will be stored and clone the GitHub repository of ControlPanel’s Dashboard.

To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/controlpanel && cd /var/www/controlpanel

git clone https://github.com/Ctrlpanel-gg/panel.git ./

```
## Step 3: Database Setup


To make a database and database user, you can follow this guide. This is for MariaDB. Please change the USE_YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD part to your password. Also, 127.0.0.1 is for localhost. Please have basic knowledge of Linux before attempting this. Use at your own responsibility.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE controlpanel;
CREATE USER 'controlpaneluser'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'USE_YOUR_OWN_PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON controlpanel.* TO 'controlpaneluser'@'127.0.0.1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

```




## Step 4: Set permissions
The forth step is to configure the web server to serve the dashboard files and enable SSL encryption.

To do this, create a file called ctrlpanel.conf in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ with the following content:

```bash
server {
        listen 80;
        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate/file;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/certificate/key;
        root /var/www/controlpanel/public;
        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        server_name your.domain.com;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        }

        location ~ /\.ht {
                deny all;
        }
}

```
Replace your.domain.com with your actual domain name and /path/to/your/certificate/file and /path/to/your/certificate/key with the paths to your SSL certificate and key files.

If you don’t have an SSL certificate, you can use Certbot from Let’s Encrypt to obtain one for free. To install Certbot and generate a certificate, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
#install certbot for nginx
sudo apt install -y certbot
sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx
#install certificates
sudo certbot --nginx -d your.domain.com

```

After creating the ctrlpanel.conf file, enable it by creating a symbolic link in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ and restart NGINX:

```bash
# You do not need to symlink this file if you are using CentOS.
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ctrlpanel.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ctrlpanel.conf

# Check for nginx errors
sudo nginx -t

# You need to restart nginx regardless of OS. only do this you haven't received any errors
systemctl restart nginx

## Step 5: Configure web server
The fifth step is to configure the web server to serve the dashboard files and enable SSL encryption.

To do this, create a file called ctrlpanel.conf in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ with the following content:

```

## Step 5 : Panel Installation

First, we will have to install all composer packages. For this, navigate into your /var/www/controlpanel again and run the following command

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

```

Set permissions

Set the correct permissions on the dashboard files so that the web server can use them correctly.

To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
# If using NGINX or Apache (not on CentOS):
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/controlpanel/
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/

# If using NGINX on CentOS:
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/controlpanel/
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/

# If using Apache on CentOS
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/controlpanel/
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/

```


## Step 6: Run the Web installer
This step is to run the web installer that will guide you through the dashboard setup process.

To do this, open your web browser and navigate to https://your.domain.com/install.

You will need to provide the following information:

Database name, username, password, and host
Admin email, username, and password
Site name, description, and logo
Billing settings, such as currency, tax rate, and credit price
Email settings, such as SMTP host, port, username, password, and encryption
If you encounter problems with the email setup, you can use the skip button and set it up later.

Once the web installer has been completed, you will be redirected to the login page of your dashboard.

## Step 7: Configure queue and cron
The final step is to configure the queue and cron jobs that are responsible for handling background tasks such as billing users hourly and suspending unpaid servers.

To do this, create a file called ctrlpanel.service in /etc/systemd/system with the following content:

```bash
# Ctrlpanel Queue Worker File
# ----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Ctrlpanel Queue Worker

[Service]
# On some systems the user and group might be different.
# Some systems use `apache` or `nginx` as the user and group.
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/controlpanel/artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

After creating the ctrlpanel.service file, enable it and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now ctrlpanel.service

```
Next, open the crontab file by running crontab -e and paste the following line at the end:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/controlpanel/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

```

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed ControlPanel’s Dashboard on your Hetzner Cloud server. You can now log in to your dashboard and start managing your Pterodactyl servers and clients.
