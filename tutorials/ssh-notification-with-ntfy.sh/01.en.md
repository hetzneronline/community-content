## Introduction

SSH Hardening is the first step in setting up a server but often times we underestimate the importance of monitoring the SSH logins. This is especially important if you have multiple developers accessing the server or if you are using a service like GitHub that logs in to the server via SSH to deploy your app. This can be useful for keeping track of who is accessing your server and when, and can help you flag any unauthorized access attempts.

The tutorial contains instructions to use an open source notification service [ntfy.sh](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) to send notifications to your phone and desktop whenever a user or a service logs in to your server via SSH along with their IP address and geolocation by taking advntage of [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) in Linux. For geolocation we will use [IP info](https://ipinfo.io/) API, this step is completely optional.

To keep this tutorial focussed, we will be using the hosted and free version of [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) service. If you wish to self host it, you can read the further instructions [here](https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/#docker). This is a free service that allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via a simple HTTP API. You can also use other notification services like Gotify, Pushover, or even email if you prefer.

**Prerequisites**

- [SSH key](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/), install wit `sudo apt-get install jq`

## Step 1 - Create a topic on ntfy.sh

Signup on [Ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh/app) to make a topic in and note down randomly generated the topic name. Keep it safe like a secret token as it will be used to send notifications.

### Step 1.1 Mobile setup

Download and Install ntfy.sh on your phone. You can find the instructions the links [here](https://ntfy.sh/). Add this topic to your phone and subscribe to it.

## Step 2 - Testing the topic

Before integrating the topic into your scripts, you can perform a quick test to ensure it is working correctly. Use the following curl command to send a test notification:

```bash
export NTFY_TOPIC=7vU179WmVM4aExl3
curl -s -d "Hetzner is ‚ú®" https://ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC | jq
# {
#   "id": "uWimBFI2ritm",
#   "time": 1744145059,
#   "expires": 1744188259,
#   "event": "message",
#   "topic": "7vU179WmVM4aExl3",
#   "message": "Hetzner is ‚ú®"
# }
```

If the topic is working, you should receive a notification on your subscribed devices. This step ensures that the topic is functional before proceeding with further configurations.

## Step 3 - Echoing the IP address on login

To display the IP address upon login, create a new script called `ssh-login-notify.sh` in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory. Make the script executable using `chmod +x /etc/profile.d/ssh-login-notify.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

USER_NAME=$(whoami)
HOST_NAME=$(hostname)
TIME_NOW=$(TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date "+%a, %b %d, %I:%M %p CEST")
NTFY_TOPIC="7vU179WmVM4aExl3"

IP_ADDRESS=$(who | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d '()' | head -n 1)

if [ -z "$IP_ADDRESS" ]; then
    IP_ADDRESS=${SSH_CONNECTION%% \*}
fi

[ -z "$IP_ADDRESS" ] && IP_ADDRESS="unknown"

MESSAGE="üö® $USER_NAME logged in from $IP_ADDRESS on $HOST_NAME at $TIME_NOW"

echo "$MESSAGE"
```

Once set up, this script will automatically display the login IP address on the terminal each time a user logs in via SSH.

```bash
Last login: Sun Apr 6 20:25:14 2025 from 203.0.113.1
üö® holu logged in from 203.0.113.1 on hetzner at Mon, Apr 07, 10:45 AM CEST
```

## Step 4 - IP geolocation - Where is the login coming from? (Optional)

To get the geolocation of the IP address, we will use the third party API as show below. This step is optional, and you can skip it if you don't want to use geolocation.

```bash
GEO_INFO=""

if [[ "$IP_ADDRESS" != "unknown" && "$IP_ADDRESS" != "127.0.0.1" && "$IP_ADDRESS" != ::1 ]]; then
  GEO_JSON=$(curl -s "https://ipinfo.io/$IP_ADDRESS/json")
  CITY=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.city')
  REGION=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.region')
  COUNTRY=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.country')
  ORG=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.org')

  GEO_INFO="üåç Location: $CITY, $REGION, $COUNTRY"
fi
```

## Step 5 - Sending the notification on login

To send the notification via ntfy.sh, we will curl. You can use the following lines to your script to replace the `echo` command.

```bash

MESSAGE="$USER_NAME logged in from $IP_ADDRESS on $HOST_NAME at $TIME_NOW
$GEO_INFO"

NTFY_TOPIC="7vU179WmVM4aExl3"

curl -s -o /dev/null \
      -X POST -H "Title: SSH Login" \
      -d $MESSAGE \
      https://ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC
```

## Step 6 - PAM configuration for Non-interactive logins (optional)

The script we have written till now will work on interactive sessions. But if you want notifications for non-interactive logins as well such as `scp` or running a remote command via ssh like `ssh hetzner "cat /etc/issue"`, there is one additional step.

Instead of placing the file in `/etc/profile.d/`, where it runs for all interactive sessions, we need to move it to `/usr/bin/local/` directory that contains all the user defined scripts and then add it to the `pam.d` configuration for it to run for system-wide SSH notifications.

After moving it to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory, add the following line at the end of `/etc/pam.d/sshd`.

```bash
session optional pam_exec.so /usr/local/bin/ssh-login-notify.sh
```

This line tells PAM to execute the script every time a user logs in via SSH. The `session` keyword indicates that this is a session management module, and `optional` means that the login will still succeed even if the script fails.

After this, don't forget to restart the SSH service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## Complete Script

This will execute the script every time a user logs in via SSH, including non-interactive logins. The script will send a notification to the ntfy.sh topic with the user's name, IP address, hostname, and geolocation information.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

USER_NAME=$PAM_USER
HOST_NAME=$(hostname)
TIME_NOW=$(TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date "+%a, %b %d, %I:%M %p CEST")
NTFY_TOPIC="7vU179WmVM4aExl3"

# Get IP address
IP_ADDRESS=$(who | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d '()' | head -n 1)

# Fallback to SSH_CONNECTION if IP is empty
if [ -z "$IP_ADDRESS" ]; then
  IP_ADDRESS=${SSH_CONNECTION%% *}
fi

[ -z "$IP_ADDRESS" ] && IP_ADDRESS="unknown"

# echo "üö® $USER_NAME logged ($close_session) from $IP_ADDRESS on $HOST_NAME at $TIME_NOW"

# Function to convert country code to flag emoji
flag() {
  local code="${1^^}"
  local first=$(( $(printf "%d" "'${code:0:1}") - 65 + 0x1F1E6 ))
  local second=$(( $(printf "%d" "'${code:1:1}") - 65 + 0x1F1E6 ))
  printf '%b' "$(printf '\\U%08X\\U%08X' "$first" "$second")"
}

if [[ $PAM_TYPE == 'close_session' ]]; then
  exit 0
fi
# Get geolocation information
GEO_INFO=""
if [[ "$IP_ADDRESS" != "unknown" && "$IP_ADDRESS" != "127.0.0.1" && "$IP_ADDRESS" != ::1 ]]; then
  GEO_JSON=$(curl -s "https://ipinfo.io/$IP_ADDRESS/json")
  CITY=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.city')
  REGION=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.region')
  COUNTRY=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.country')
  ORG=$(echo "$GEO_JSON" | jq -r '.org')

  GEO_INFO="üåç $CITY, $REGION, $COUNTRY $(flag $COUNTRY)"
fi

MESSAGE="$USER_NAME logged in from $IP_ADDRESS on $HOST_NAME at $TIME_NOW
$GEO_INFO"

if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then
  curl -s -o /dev/null \
	  -X POST -H "Title: SSH Login $(date +%s)" \
	  -d "$MESSAGE" ... \
	  -H "Markdown: yes" \
	  https://ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC
fi

```

We use `$PAM_USER` to get the username of the user logging in, instead of `whoami` because it will return the user who is executing the script, which will always be `root`. We also include early exit condition based on `$PAM_TYPE` to check if the session is closing or opening. If we don't, it will send a notification every login in as well as log out.

## Conclusion

With this script, one can build a lightweight audit trail for all logins in your server or across the entire fleet. You can also customise notification for different channels distinguishing between a deploy script and a developer. Since the login IP is available, you can flag logins from outside trusted regions (e.g., outside the Netherlands) or maintain a whitelist of trusted IPs that bypass notifications entirely. The possibilities are endless and this can be extended to notify services like email, slack, telegram or even a custom webhook.

Knowing these basics opens the door to all kinds of monitoring; whether it‚Äôs tracking login origins, highlighting unexpected locations, or just staying informed. Not too dissimilar to the smart bell we all have at home, but for your server.
