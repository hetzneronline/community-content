## 1. What is HSTS?

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security mechanism for HTTPS connections.

It protects against:
- Downgrade attacks (forcing a fallback to HTTP)
- Session hijacking (stealing session information)

The server instructs the browser to only use encrypted connections for a specified time (max-age) when connecting to this domain.

## 2. How it works

HSTS is enabled by sending the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP response header.

Example:
`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- `max-age=31536000 → 1 year in seconds`
- `includeSubDomains → Applies to all subdomains`
- `preload → Allows the domain to be added to browsers’ HSTS preload list`

## 3. Requirements
- Your site must already be fully accessible via HTTPS.
- All resources (images, scripts, CSS) must load over HTTPS, or browsers will block them.
- preload requires that HTTPS is permanently enforced for the entire domain.

## 4. Implementation in .htaccess

To enable HSTS and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, add the following to your .htaccess file:

```# Enforce HTTPS
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

```# Set HSTS header
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
</IfModule>
```

## 5. Tips & Best Practices
- Test the redirect and header in a staging environment first.
- Use Header always set instead of just Header set to ensure the header is sent even on redirects.
- Check your HSTS configuration with:

- If you use preload, you can submit your domain to the HSTS preload list, enforcing HTTPS for all visitors.
