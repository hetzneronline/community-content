## Introduction

In this tutorial I'm going to cover how to install `Spigot 1.20.2` on an `Ubuntu 22.04` server. 

### What is Spigot?

The Spigot Community is maintaining a fork of the Minecraft Server called Spigot. 
It is a high performance fork of CraftBukkit. 
It is a modified Minecraft Server based on CraftBukkit which provides additional performance optimizations, 
configuration options and features, whilst still remaining compatible with all existing plugins and consistent with 
Vanilla Minecraft game mechanics.

You can install all kind of plugins, e.g. multi world, minigames, economy, and much more.

Please mind: This tutorial covers a Minecraft Server for the Minecraft Java Edition.
If you want to play with Minecraft Bedrock players, please check out the [Geyser Project](https://geysermc.org/).


**Prerequisites**

* A Minecraft Java Edition Account
* [Create Ubuntu 22.04 server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server/)


## Installation

### Step 1 - Login to server

Login to your server with root user:

```shell
ssh <your-servers-ip-address> -l root
```

### Step 2 - Update your server

After a successful login, we need to update our server.

For this we run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Step 3 - Install required packages

Next, we will install the OpenJDK - the Java Developer Kit. Run below command for that.

```shell
sudo apt install openjdk-19-jdk -y
```

### Step 4 - Build your Minecraft Spigot Server (1.20.2)

To run your Minecraft Server, we need to build the Spigot.jar. 
You can change the version number if you want.

So we need to download the Spigot BuildTools by running the following commands:

```shell
mkdir spigot && cd spigot
wget https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar
java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.20.2 latest
cd ..
```

### Step 5 - Setup your Minecraft Server

Now with the below commands, we are downloading the Spigot BuildTools and build our Minecraft Spigot Server.

```shell
mkdir minecraft && cd minecraft
cp ../spigot/spigot-1.20.2.jar spigot.jar

# [optional]
# I recommend to use the WorldBorder plugin to prevent your players from going too far away.
# Also you can use it to pre-generate your world, for a better performance at the beginning of your adventure.
mkdir plugins && cd plugins
wget https://github.com/PryPurity/WorldBorder/releases/download/v2.1.5/WorldBorder.jar
cd ../
# [/optional]

echo "eula=true" > eula.txt
# 3G means 3 Gigabyte of memory
# recommendation: a 4GB cloud server can easily provide 3GB memory to your Minecraft Server
java -Xms1G -Xmx3G -XX:+UseG1GC -jar spigot.jar nogui
```

If you did install the WorldBorder plugin, you can now pre-generate your world. 
Feel free to change the world border radius to your needs. 
Please mind: The radius is in blocks, so 1000 is 1000 blocks in each direction. 
A higher radius will take longer to generate.

```shell
# Run these commands within your Minecraft Server console
wb world set 1024 spawn
wb world fill
wb fill confirm
```

## Conclusion

Happy playing! ðŸŽ®
