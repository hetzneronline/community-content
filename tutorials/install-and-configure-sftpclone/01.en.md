## Introduction

[sftpclone](https://github.com/unbit/sftpclone) is an SFTP based backup software that works similarly to rsync. In fact, it copies and keeps updated the whole tree underneath a specific directory, managing at the same time to update symbolic links, access times, and so on.

## Installation

sftpclone is written in Python (supports both version 2 and 3) and you can install it by using PIP:

```
# you can choose to install it in either user or root space
$ pip install sftpclone --user
$ sudo pip install sftpclone
```

If PIP is not installed, then you'll need to install that first. You can check [this guide](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) for instructions.

Once installed you'll get an sftpclone executable.

## Configuration

You can use the `-h` flag to inspect all the possible configuration parameters, and you can check the [project page](https://github.com/unbit/sftpclone) for more detailed documentation.

```
$ sftpclone -h

usage: sftpclone [-h] [-k private-key-path]
                    [-l {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG,NOTSET}] [-p PORT]
                    [-f] [-a] [-c ssh config path] [-n known_hosts path] [-d]
                    [-e exclude-from-file-path]
                    local-path user[:password]@hostname:remote-path
```

The simplest possible configuration only specifies the local folder to backup and the remote endpoint:

`$ sftpclone local-path user[:password]@hostname:remote-path`

As usual, clear text passwords are bad. As such, you should specify your private key and use it to avoid password login, as explained in the [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/backup-space-ssh-keys/).

__Please note:__ if you don't specify a password, sftpclone will automatically fallback to public key authentication.

You can also specify a list of files to be ignored, see [Github info](https://github.com/unbit/sftpclone#exclude-list).

__Warning:__ be sure to select a proper remote folder. The synchronization process will delete any file that doesn't exist in the local folder.

Once you have chosen the sftpclone command/configuration that best suits your needs, you can set a cronjob to let the backup process happen on a regular basis. You can store the script either under `/etc/cron.daily` (daily), `/etc/cron.weekly` (weekly) or `/etc/cron.monthly` (monthly).

A crontab can also be used to schedule an exact time by setting up a file under `/etc/cron.d/`:

```
# /etc/cron.d/sftpclone
0 0 * * * root sftpclone local-path user[:password]@hostname:remote-path 
[-k private-key-path] > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Here is a full working example:

```
# /etc/cron.d/sftpclone
0 0 * * * root sftpclone / aldur@aldur-host:root_backup > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Conclusion

By now you should have installed and configured SFTPclone to run a regular backup.
