## Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through configuring cPanel backups to a Hetzner Storage Box. Hetzner Storage Boxes are efficient and secure solutions for offsite backups, allowing you to store data away from your primary server. By the end of this tutorial, your cPanel server will automatically upload backups to the Hetzner Storage Box, ensuring reliable data protection.

### Prerequisites
- A cPanel/WHM server.
- Access to a Hetzner Storage Box with valid credentials.
- SSH access to your cPanel server.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands.

Example placeholders used:
- **Username:** `u123456`
- **Hostname:** `u123456.your-storagebox.de`

## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Hetzner Storage Box
1. Log in to the Hetzner Robot Interface.
2. Navigate to the **Storage Boxes** section and select your Storage Box.
3. Note the **FTP/SSH/Samba credentials** provided.
4. Ensure that **SSH** is enabled for the Storage Box in its settings.

### Step 2: Configure cPanel Backup System
1. Log in to WHM on your cPanel server.
2. Navigate to **Backup Configuration** (Home > Backup > Backup Configuration).
3. Enable **Backups** by checking the "Enable Backups" option.
4. Choose the backup type (e.g., Compressed, Uncompressed, or Incremental).
5. Set the backup schedule and retention policy according to your requirements.
6. Click **Save Configuration**.

### Step 3: Set Up Remote Destination
1. In WHM, navigate to **Backup Configuration** > **Additional Destinations**.
2. Click **Create New Destination** and select **Custom Destination**.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Destination Type:** `SFTP` or `rsync`.
   - **Name:** `HetznerStorageBox` (or a name of your choice).
   - **Backup Directory:** `/backup` (or another directory on the Storage Box).
   - **Remote Host:** `<storage_box_hostname>` (e.g., `u123456.your-storagebox.de`).
   - **Port:** `23` (default for SSH/SFTP or rsync).
   - **Remote Username:** `<storage_box_username>`.
   - **Remote Password:** `<storage_box_password>`.
4. Click **Save and Validate Destination** to ensure the connection works.

### Step 4: Test Backup Configuration
1. In WHM, navigate to **Backup Configuration** > **Additional Destinations**.
2. Select the Hetzner Storage Box destination and click **Transfer Backups to Destination**.
3. Verify that backups are successfully uploaded to the Storage Box.

### Step 5: Automate Backups
1. Confirm that the backup schedule is active in the **Backup Configuration** section.
2. Monitor backups to ensure that daily/weekly backups are automatically transferred to the Hetzner Storage Box.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you have successfully configured cPanel to use a Hetzner Storage Box for offsite backups. This setup enhances data security and provides a reliable recovery option in case of server failures.
