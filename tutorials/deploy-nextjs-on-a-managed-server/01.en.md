## Introduction

In this tutorial we will deploy a Next.js application on a Hetzner Webhosting or Managed Server.

**Prerequisites**

* Managed Server or Webhosting L/XL
* SSH access

## Step 1 - Set Node.js version

Depending on which Node.js version your application requires, execute one of the following commands:
```bash
# for v20
echo 20 > ~/.nodeversion

# for v22
echo 22 > ~/.nodeversion

# for v24
echo 24 > ~/.nodeversion
```

Use v24 if you create a new application.

You can check the currently used version via `node -v`.

## Step 2 - Create Next.js application

Change into your home directory and create a new Next.js application via the following command:

```bash
cd "$HOME"
npx create-next-app@latest
cd example-app/ # Replace example-app with the name of your app
```


Alternatively, you can upload your existing application via FTP, SFTP or clone it from your Git repository.

## Step 3 - Build your Next.js application
Create a production build via 
```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 4 - Configure the application in konsoleH

Configure the application in the [Node.js menu](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/account-management/configuration/nodejs) of konsoleH. Enter the following values in the form:

Script path: `node_modules/.bin/next` \
Working directory: `example-app/` \
Log path: `example-app/log.txt` \
Memory limit: `1024 MB` \
Version: `24`

Add `start` as an Argument.

Finally, click the `Enable` button.


## Step 5 - Test
Open your domain in the browser and you should see your Next.js application.

## Conclusion

You now have a production-ready deployment of your Next.js application.
