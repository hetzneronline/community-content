## Introduction

We'll be preparing a CentOS 8 image on a local VM so we can roll out our own custom CentOS 8 image on Hetzner boxes.

**Prerequisites**

You will need a virtualisation tool to install CentOS 8. I used GNOME Boxes, a popular alternative would be VirtualBox. I'm assuming all the commands in the VM are run as root.

## Step 1 - Install CentOS 8 in a VM

You can download the install image from any of the mirrors: [CentOS 8](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/8/isos/x86_64/) or [CentOS 8 Stream](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/8-stream/isos/x86_64/). I strongly recommend getting the much smaller "boot" version.

Settings for the VM box don't matter. Just install it as you normally would.

## Step 2 - Preparing the CentOS 8 image

To make the CentOS 8 image work with the `installimage` script we'll need to make some preparations first.

### Step 2.1 - Install systemd with systemd-networkd support

systemd in CentOS 8 is compiled without systemd-networkd support so you'll have to compile it yourself or get it compiled from an unofficial repo. The latter is much easier so we're doing that.

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/systemd-networkd.repo` with the following content:

```
[systemd-networkd]
name=systemd-networkd
baseurl=https://people.redhat.com/~jsynacek/systemd/systemd-rebuild-networkd/rhel-8.dev-x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled =0
```

This repo contains an older version of systemd so we'll need to downgrade rather than install.

```bash
yum --enablerepo=systemd-networkd -y downgrade systemd
```

### Step 2.2 - Symlink dracut

The Hetzner `installimage` script looks for dracut in `/sbin`. CentOS 8, however, installs this in `/usr/bin` so we should symlink it.

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/dracut /sbin/dracut
```

### Step 2.3 - Install mdraid module

The Hetzner `installimage` script uses the mdraid module which is not installed with a minimal CentOS 8 install so let's install it.

```bash
yum -y install libblockdev-mdraid
```

### Step 2.4 - Set SELinux to permissive

We're setting it to permissive to avoid headaches at the first boot of our Hetzner box. We'll be setting it back to enforcing later on.

Set the following in `/etc/sysconfig/selinux`

```
SELINUX=permissive
```

### Step 2.5 - Configure/install additional things (optional)

At this point you can configure your install any way you like. If you want your base image to have `vim` for example, you can install it now.

### Step 2.6 - Create a compressed tar image of your box

If you did a bare minimum install you may still need to install `tar`

```bash
yum -y install tar
```

Create an archive of the entire file system, minus `/dev`, `/proc` and `/sys`.

The filename of the archive gets parsed by the `installimage` script so it should be of the format `CentOS-version-arch-optional.tar.gz`.

```bash
cd /
tar zcvf CentOS-80-64-boot.tar.gz /bin /boot /etc /home /lib /lib64 /media /mnt /opt /root /run /sbin /srv /tmp /usr /var
```

## Step 3 - Installing the image

Now that we have our image we'll finally be installing it on our Hetzner VM. Start of by rebooting your Hetzner VM into rescue mode through the Hetzner cloud dashboard.

Transfer the image from your local CentOS 8 install to your VM in rescue mode. We'll be using scp for this so from your local CentOS 8 box, execute

```bash
scp /CentOS-80-64-boot.tar.gz root@<hetzner-vm-ip>:/root
```

Now on your Hetzner VM in rescue mode, start the `installimage` script interactively.

```bash
installimage
```

On the image selection screen, choose the `Custom image` option and you'll get dropped in an editor. You can configure several options of your VM here, like partitioning or your hostname. Do as you please.

At the very end of this file is an `IMAGE` option. Simply add the path to your image here, press F10 to exit, save when prompted and your VM will be installed.

```
IMAGE /root/CentOS-80-64-boot.tar.gz
```

## Step 4 - Cleanup (optional)

This step is optional but highly advised. CentOS 8 doesn't come with systemd-networkd support and because we only needed this for `installimage` to work, I recommend you to reinstall the systemd version from the `BaseOS` repo. Remove the systemd-networkd repo and install systemd again.

```bash
rm -rf /etc/yum.repos.d/systemd-networkd
yum -y install systemd
```

We should also set SELinux to enforcing again. First, let's relabel the filesystem.

```bash
touch /.autorelabel
reboot
```

Now set SELinux back to enforcing in `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` and reboot to check if everything's working.

```
SELINUX=enforcing
```

## Conclusion

You now know how to create a custom (CentOS 8) image you can use to install with the `installimage` script provided by Hetzner and install said image.
