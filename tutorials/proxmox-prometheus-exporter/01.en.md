## Introduction

With the help of a specific exporter, which queries the Proxmox API in the background, an existing Prometheus (and Grafana) stack can scrape data about your Proxmox environment.

At the end of this tutorial, we will be able to gather metrics about CPU, RAM, disk and network resources, as well of guests (CTs or VMs) via Prometheus. With a Grafana dashboard you can view these metrics.

**Prerequisites**

This tutorial does not cover the installation of Proxmox and Prometheus itself. See [this tutorial](/tutorials/install-and-configure-prometheus-stack) for installing the Prometheus stack and [this tutorial](/tutorials/install-and-configure-proxmox_ve) for Proxmox installation.

This tutorial has been tested on Debian 10 and 11.

* Hetzner bare-metal server
* functional Proxmox installation
* functional Prometheus stack
* Running SSH session  as root

The exporter itself can be started on the Proxmox node itself or on another machine. **For this tutorial we assume the exporter will run on the Proxmox node.**

## Step 1 - Create Proxmox read-only API user

We will create a dedicated Proxmox user because anonymous data collection is not permitted. This user will have read-only permissions.

Log in to your proxmox host and ensure youÂ´re working as root

```bash
$ pveum user add pve-exporter@pve -comment "PVE-Exporter" -password <secure passphrase or password>
$ pveum aclmod / -user pve-exporter@pve -role PVEAuditor
```

## Step 2 - Create linux user

For running the exporter as daemon / systemd unit we create a dedicated user.

```bash
$ useradd -c "pve exporter" -m -s /bin/false pve-exporter
```

## Step 3 - Install package and python dependencies

The pve exporter is written in Python and we will install it within a so called venv (virtual environment). The use of such a venv makes python dependency handling much easier compared to regular installation with pip.

There are a few debian packages needed to ensure a proper installation process of the venv itself and the pve exporter.

```bash
$ apt-get update && apt-get install python3-venv python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-pip libffi-dev libssl-dev build-essential -y
```

## Step 4 - Create and activate venv, install prometheus-pve-exporter

We will create the mentioned venv and install the package prometheus-pve-exporter from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus-pve-exporter/)

```bash
$ python3 -m venv /opt/prometheus-pve-exporter
$ source /opt/prometheus-pve-exporter/bin/activate
```

Check if `(prometheus-pve-exporter)` is present in front of your command line prompt before executing the next command.

```bash
(prometheus-pve-exporter) $ pip install prometheus-pve-exporter
```

On Debian 10 an error message (`Failed to build proxmoxer`) may be displayed. This is not an issue, simply verify everything has been installed by executing the command again. It should finish in very short time and all lines should begin with "Requirement already satisfied".

Finally leave the venv by executing `deactivate`

```bash
(prometheus-pve-exporter) $ deactivate
$ 
```

## Step 5 - Configure prometheus-pve-exporter

Place the previously created credentials for Proxmox user `pve-exporter` in a .yml file.

```bash
$ mkdir -p /etc/prometheus
$ cat <<EOF > /etc/prometheus/pve.yml
default:
    user: pve-exporter@pve
    password: <secure passphrase or password>
    # only needed when you not configured Lets Encrypt 
    # verify_ssl: false
EOF
$ chown root.pve-exporter /etc/prometheus/pve.yml
$ chmod 640 /etc/prometheus/pve.yml
```

## Step 6 - Configure systemd unit for prometheus-pve-exporter

Place service unit to /etc/systemd/system.

```bash
$ cat <<EOF> /etc/systemd/system/prometheus-pve-exporter.service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus exporter for Proxmox VE
Documentation=https://github.com/znerol/prometheus-pve-exporter

[Service]
Restart=always
User=pve-exporter
ExecStart=/opt/prometheus-pve-exporter/bin/pve_exporter /etc/prometheus/pve.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Reload SystemD, start and enable the service.

```bash
$ systemctl daemon-reload 
$ systemctl start prometheus-pve-exporter.service
$ systemctl enable prometheus-pve-exporter.service
```

Verify the tcp port 9221 (which is the default) is open:

```bash
$ ss -lntp | grep 9221
LISTEN 0      128          0.0.0.0:9221      0.0.0.0:*    users:(("pve_exporter",pid=7539,fd=3))
```

In some configurations it is necessary to note the IP address in front of :9221. You will need it in the next step. Normally pve-exporter binds to 0.0.0.0 which means that you can reach the exporter over every interface.

## Step 7 - Test functionality

Access the endpoint which provide the metrics via cURL.

```bash
$ curl -s localhost:9221/pve
```

Check output of cURL command, at the end there should be a line like this

```bash
...
# HELP pve_version_info Proxmox VE version info
# TYPE pve_version_info gauge
pve_version_info{release="6.4",repoid="9f411e79",version="6.4-13"} 1.0
```

## Step 8 - Extend your Prometheus configuration

Extend the `scrape_config` area in your existing Prometheus configuration with the following lines:

```bash
your-prometheus-host $ vim /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

  - job_name: 'pve-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - your-proxmox-host:9221
    metrics_path: /pve
    params:
      module: [default]

your-prometheus-host $ systemctl restart prometheus
```

## Step 9 - Import the corresponding Grafana dashboard

Log in to your Grafana instance, navigate to `Dashboards`, press the import button, insert the ID `10347` and click load.

You can find the dashboard here:
[https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10347](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10347)

## Conclusion

With the great [prometheus-pve-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter) we have a simple and powerful tool which allows us to see which guests on the proxmox node take how much resources. Besides it provides general overview of proxmox host system health (Storage usage, Space allocation, ...).
