## Introduction

Harbor is an open-source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. It serves as a central repository for container images, ensuring their integrity and access control across environments. In this guide, you'll learn how to install the latest version of Harbor and configure it for storing container images.

Harbor can be deployed as a set of Docker containers, and this tutorial assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Operating System**: A server running a supported Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or CentOS 7).
2. **Root or Sudo Access**: Administrative privileges to install software and modify system configurations.
3. **Docker**: Docker Engine version 17.06.0-ce or later installed.
4. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose version 1.18.0 or later installed.
5. **Domain Name**: A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for accessing Harbor.

Ensure all these prerequisites are met before proceeding with the installation and configuration of Harbor.

---

## Step 1: Download and Extract the Harbor Installer

To install Harbor, the first step is downloading and extracting the Harbor installer. Follow these instructions:

### Download the Latest Installer

Use the following command to download the offline installer for the latest version of Harbor (v2.12.1 in this example):

```bash
wget https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/download/v2.12.1/harbor-offline-installer-v2.12.1.tgz
```

### Extract the Installer

1. Extract the downloaded installer:
   ```bash
   tar xzvf harbor-offline-installer-v2.12.1.tgz
   ```
2. The extraction creates a directory named `harbor` with the following files:
   ```
   harbor/harbor.v2.12.1.tar.gz
   harbor/prepare
   harbor/LICENSE
   harbor/install.sh
   harbor/common.sh
   harbor/harbor.yml.tmpl
   ```

### Verify the Installer Directory

1. Navigate to the `harbor` directory:
   ```bash
   cd harbor
   ```
2. Verify its contents by listing the files:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   The output should be:
   ```
   harbor.v2.12.1.tar.gz
   prepare
   LICENSE
   install.sh
   common.sh
   harbor.yml.tmpl
   ```

---

You’re now ready to move to Step 2, where you’ll configure the `harbor.yml` file to prepare for Harbor installation.

---

## Step 2: Configure the `harbor.yml` File

Before installing Harbor, you must configure the `harbor.yml` file to define the system settings and parameters. Follow these steps to set up the configuration:

### Locate the `harbor.yml` Template

The extracted Harbor installer includes a configuration template file named `harbor.yml.tmpl`. You need to create the `harbor.yml` file based on this template.

1. Navigate to the Harbor directory:
   ```bash
   cd harbor
   ```
2. Copy the template file to create the actual configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp harbor.yml.tmpl harbor.yml
   ```

### Edit the `harbor.yml` File

1. Open the `harbor.yml` file in a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`):
   ```bash
   nano harbor.yml
   ```
2. Modify the following key parameters:

   - **`hostname`**: Set this to the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Harbor server.
     ```yaml
     hostname: <example.com>
     ```
     Replace `<example.com>` with your server's actual domain or hostname.

   - **HTTPS Configuration**: Enable HTTPS by specifying the certificate and private key paths.
     ```yaml
     https:
       port: 443
       certificate: /etc/letsencrypt/live/<example.com>/fullchain.pem
       private_key: /etc/letsencrypt/live/<example.com>/privkey.pem
     ```
     Replace `<example.com>` with your domain.

   - **Admin Password**: Set an initial password for the Harbor admin user. The default username is `admin`.
     ```yaml
     harbor_admin_password: YourStrongPassword
     ```

   - **Data Volume**: Specify the directory where Harbor will store data. The default is `/data`.
     ```yaml
     data_volume: /data
     ```

   - **Database Password**: Optionally, set a password for the internal PostgreSQL database.
     ```yaml
     database:
       password: YourDatabasePassword
     ```

3. Save and close the file.

---

### Generate SSL Certificates with Certbot

If you do not already have an SSL certificate for your domain, you can generate one using Certbot and Let’s Encrypt.

1. Install Certbot on your system:
   - **For Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install certbot -y
     ```
   - **For CentOS/RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install certbot -y
     ```

2. Stop any services using ports 80 and 443, such as Nginx or Apache:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop nginx
   sudo systemctl stop apache2
   ```

3. Run Certbot to generate the certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone --agree-tos --no-eff-email --email your-email@example.com -d <example.com>
   ```
   This will create the certificate and private key in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<example.com>/` directory.

4. Restart any stopped services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

---

### Verify the Configuration

Check that the `harbor.yml` file has been updated correctly:

```bash
cat harbor.yml
```

Ensure all parameters reflect your intended configuration.

---

With the `harbor.yml` file configured, including the SSL certificate paths, you are now ready to proceed to Step 3, where you’ll install and start Harbor.

---

## Step 3: Install Docker,  and Start Harbor Installation

Harbor requires Docker (version 17.06.0-ce or later) and Docker Compose (version 1.18.0 or later). Follow these steps to ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly before proceeding with Harbor installation.

### Remove Old Docker Versions

If you have older versions of Docker or related packages installed, remove them to avoid conflicts:

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

### Set Up Docker's apt Repository

Before installing Docker, add its official repository to your system:

1. Update the package index and install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
   ```

2. Add Docker's GPG key:
   ```bash
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   ```

3. Add the Docker repository to apt sources:
   ```bash
   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

   > Note: For Ubuntu derivatives (e.g., Linux Mint), use `UBUNTU_CODENAME` instead of `VERSION_CODENAME`.

### Install Docker

1. Install the latest version of Docker:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   ```

2. Verify the Docker installation:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```
   This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container, printing a confirmation message.

### Install Docker Compose

1. Update the package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install the Docker Compose plugin:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
   ```

3. Verify Docker Compose installation:
   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```
   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   Docker Compose version vN.N.N
   ```


### Run the Harbor Installation Script

1. Navigate to the Harbor directory:
   ```bash
   cd harbor
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```


### Start Harbor Services

1. Use Docker Compose to start Harbor:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This command starts Harbor services as containers in detached mode. The output should resemble:
   ```

   ✔ Container harbor-core        Running                                                                                                                 0.0s
   ✔ Container nginx              Running                                                                                                                 0.0s
   ✔ Container harbor-jobservice  Running                                                                                                                 0.0s
   ```

2. Verify that the containers are running:
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   ```
   You should see several containers, including `nginx`, `core`, `portal`, and others, in a running state.

### Access the Harbor Interface

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your Harbor instance:
   ```
   https://<example.com>
   ```
2. Log in with the default username `admin` and the password you set in the `harbor.yml` file.

---

Harbor is now successfully installed and ready for use. Proceed to configure image storage and push/pull operations in the next step.

---

## Step 4: Configure Image Storage and Push/Pull Operations

Once Harbor is successfully installed and running, you can start configuring image storage and perform push/pull operations. Follow the steps below:

### Create a Project in Harbor

1. Log in to the Harbor web interface:
   - URL: `https://<example.com>`
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: The one you set in `harbor.yml`.

2. Navigate to the **Projects** tab.

3. Click **New Project**, and provide the following details:
   - **Project Name**: `my-project` (or any desired name).
   - **Access Level**: Choose **Private** to restrict access or **Public** for open access.

4. Save the project.

### Log In to Harbor from Docker

Before pushing or pulling images, you need to authenticate your Docker client with Harbor.

1. Use the following command to log in:
   ```bash
   docker login <example.com>
   ```
   - Enter your Harbor username (`admin`) and password when prompted.

### Push an Image to Harbor

1. Tag the image you want to push, associating it with your Harbor repository:
   ```bash
   docker tag ubuntu:latest <example.com>/my-project/ubuntu:latest
   ```

2. Push the tagged image:
   ```bash
   docker push <example.com>/my-project/ubuntu:latest
   ```

3. Verify the image in the Harbor web interface under **Projects > my-project**.

### Pull an Image from Harbor

To pull the image back from Harbor to a Docker client:

1. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker pull <example.com>/my-project/ubuntu:latest
   ```

2. Confirm the image is pulled by listing local images:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

### Optional: Enable Content Trust (Notary)

If you wish to enable image signing for additional security:

1. Configure Docker to use content trust:
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
   ```

2. Push or pull images as usual to ensure they are signed.

---

Harbor is now configured for storing and managing container images. You can use these steps to efficiently manage your Docker images within Harbor.
