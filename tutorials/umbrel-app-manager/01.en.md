# How to Install Umbrel on a Hetzner Server

## Requirements

- 2+ GB RAM 


---


# installation :

## Step 1.1

> **before you begin:** make sure **docker** and **compose** installed.

   ```docker+compose
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```


## Step 1.2

   docker compose install: (in case you use your port 80 for other popuses you can use other ports as well)
   ```bash
services:
  umbrel:
    image: dockurr/umbrel
    container_name: umbrel
    pid: host
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - ./umbrel:/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: always
    stop_grace_period: 1m
   ```


   
   it was my clean and easy method , but `optionaly` you can go with bash install bellow instead:
   
   ```bash
   curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash
   ```


## Step 2

now you can access to your home page of your umbrel 
* Using Your IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6):
   * url: `<10.0.0.1>:80` or `<2001:db8:1234::1>:80`
