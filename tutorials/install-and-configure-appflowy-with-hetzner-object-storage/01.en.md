## Introduction

[AppFlowy](https://appflowy.io/) is an open-source alternative to Notion. In this tutorial we are going to setup our own [AppFlowy Cloud](https://docs.appflowy.io/docs/appflowy/product/appflowy-cloud) server using the official documentation by AppFlowy. We will connect AppFlowy to the [Hetzner Object Storage](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage). When you add images or videos to a document, AppFlowy will save them in your Object Storage Bucket and access them from there. This tutorial won't cover how you create a new project called "AppFlowy" or a new server. We will purely focus on setting up AppFlowy, setting up a Bucket and connecting it to our AppFlowy Cloud server.

### Prerequisites

* Server
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux), [Docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms) already installed<br>
    Verify with `git -v`, `docker -v`, `docker compose version`
  * Access via SSH

* DNS entry for your desired (sub-)domain to your server
* Optional: Dedicated Hetzner Cloud project called "AppFlowy" to pool your resources together

## Step 1 - Create a Bucket

First, we will create a new bucket in the Hetzner Cloud console.

![Click on "Create Bucket" in your project](images/create_bucket.png)

As the name of the bucket we chooose appflowy and add a UUID after it to make it unique. We can create the bucket with private visibility, as the access will happen via the server.

![Choose a unique bucket name and click on "Create & Buy now"](images/name_bucket.png)

After successfully creating the bucket, open it and copy the URL of the bucket, by clicking on it. Paste the URL into a file for later. Click on "Manage credentials" on the same screen to access the page for S3 credential creation.

![Copy the URL of your bucket](images/bucket_url.png)

Click on "Generate credentials" to create new credentials for your AppFlowy Cloud server.

![Click on "Generate credentials"](images/generate_credentials.png)

Choose a description for your new credentials.

![Click on "Generate credentials"](images/description_credentials.png)

Copy and store your access key and secret key for later usage.

## Step 2 - Set up your AppFlowy Cloud server

SSH into your server or use the Hetzner Cloud Console terminal to access your server via the web frontend.

### Step 2.1 - Clone the AppFlowy Cloud repository

Clone the AppFlowy Cloud repository to your desired location and `cd` into the cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud
cd AppFlowy-Cloud
```

### Step 2.2 - Setup the nginx proxy of AppFlowy Cloud to use your SSL certificate

Put your SSL certificate and private key into the files in `./nginx/ssl/` or adjust the location in the `docker-compose.yml` to point to your own certificates.

---------

Alternatively you can create a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate via DNS challenge on the Hetzner DNS service by using lego:

* Create SSL certificate
  ```bash
  go install github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/cmd/lego@latest
  sudo ~/go/bin/lego --domains="appflowy.example.com" --email="admin@example.com" --http run
  ```

* Adjust the `docker-compose.yml` to point to the output folder of lego:
  ```yml
    nginx:
      restart: on-failure
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - ${NGINX_PORT:-80}:80   # Disable this if you are using TLS
        - ${NGINX_TLS_PORT:-443}:443
      volumes:
        - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        - ./.lego/certificates/appflowy.example.com.crt:/etc/nginx/ssl/certificate.crt
        - ./.lego/certificates/appflowy.example.com.key:/etc/nginx/ssl/private_key.key
  ```

## Step 3 - Edit `docker-compose.yml`

* Remove the minio service
  
  Remove the minio service by deleting the following lines:
  
  ```yml
    # You do not need this if you have configured to use your own s3 file storage
    minio:
      restart: on-failure
      image: minio/minio
      environment:
        - MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost/minio
        - MINIO_ROOT_USER=${APPFLOWY_S3_ACCESS_KEY:-minioadmin}
        - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=${APPFLOWY_S3_SECRET_KEY:-minioadmin}
      command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
      volumes:
        - minio_data:/data
  ```

* Remove the minio_data volume
  
  Don't forget to remove the `minio_data` volume from the volumes at the end of the `docker-compose.yml`. Only the `postgres_data `volume should remain:
  
  ```yml
  volumes:
    postgres_data:
  ```

## Step 4 - Edit `deploy.env`

Now we need to adjust the `deploy.env` file to use our own passwords and point to the Hetzner Object Storage. I recommend to keep the order of values identical, as we are going to commit our changes locally. This makes rebasing easier.

* At the time of creation of this tutorial you should adjust the following values with your own password and SMTP configuration:
  
  ```env
  # change password and secret
  # change your database name if needed
  APPFLOWY_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres
  GOTRUE_JWT_SECRET=hello456
  GOTRUE_DATABASE_URL=postgres://supabase_auth_admin:root@postgres:5432/postgres
  APPFLOWY_AI_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres
  APPFLOWY_HISTORY_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres
  APPFLOWY_INDEXER_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres
  
  # replace with your own SMTP configuration
  GOTRUE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
  GOTRUE_SMTP_PORT=465
  GOTRUE_SMTP_USER=email_sender@some_company.com
  GOTRUE_SMTP_PASS=email_sender_password
  GOTRUE_SMTP_ADMIN_EMAIL=comp_admin@some_company.com
  APPFLOWY_MAILER_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
  APPFLOWY_MAILER_SMTP_PORT=465
  APPFLOWY_MAILER_SMTP_USERNAME=email_sender@some_company.com
  APPFLOWY_MAILER_SMTP_PASSWORD=email_sender_password
  
  # configure your admin account
  GOTRUE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
  GOTRUE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
  
  # input your (sub-)domain, which you configured in the Hetzner DNS service
  API_EXTERNAL_URL=https://appflowy.example.com
  ```

* Remove the following lines, as we won't use those services:
  
  ```env  
  # PgAdmin
  # Optional module to manage the postgres database
  # You can access the pgadmin at http://your-host/pgadmin
  # Refer to the APPFLOWY_DATABASE_URL for password when connecting to the database
  PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@example.com
  PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password
  
  # Portainer (username: admin)
  PORTAINER_PASSWORD=password1234
  
  # Cloudflare tunnel token
  CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=
  ```

* And finally configure your Object Storage:
  
  ```conf
  APPFLOWY_S3_USE_MINIO=true
  APPFLOWY_S3_MINIO_URL=https://appflowy-5d3f1744a2494fb5b49c983e3eff3e17.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com # this is where the previously copied Object Storage URL is pasted
  APPFLOWY_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<your access key> # paste your previously generated access key from the S3 credentials
  APPFLOWY_S3_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key> # paste your previously generated secret key from the S3 credentials
  APPFLOWY_S3_BUCKET=appflowy # this isn't really the name of your Bucket, but the root folder in your Bucket
  #APPFLOWY_S3_REGION=us-east-1
  ```

## Step 5 - Start AppFlowy Cloud

Now that `docker-compose.yml` and `deploy.env` are ready, you can commit your changes and start the Docker containers.

* Add and commit your changes <sup><small>`optional`</small></sup>
  
  We use git to store our changes in the git log and make it easier to pull updates from upstream. By using this method every change of defaults in the `deploy.env` and `docker-compose.yml` will result in merge conflicts when pulling an update, which you need to resolve before restarting/updating your server.
  
  ```bash
  git add deploy.env docker-compose.yml
  git commit -m "my own AppFlowy deployment on Hetzner Cloud"
  ```

* Start the AppFlowy Cloud server
  
  Start your AppFlowy Cloud server via `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`, depending on your installation method):
  
  ```bash
  docker compose --env-file deploy.env up -d
  ```

## Step 6 - Configure AppFlowy App to point to your new server

Go into the cloud settings of AppFlowy and change your server to "AppFlowy Cloud Self-hosted". Enable the sync and enter the URL of your server as Base URL. Restart AppFlowy.

## Step 7 - User creation and login

Open a browser and navigate to the URL of your server. The admin frontend will open up and you can login with the admin credentials you previously defined in `deploy.env`. Via the invite page, you can now create/invite new users:

![Invite new users](images/user_invite.png)

The new users receive a magic link for login.

In the web frontend, you also have the option to directly open AppFlowy with the account you logged into the web frontend with.

![Open AppFlowy](images/open_appflowy.png)

## Step 8 - Check if Object Storage works

AppFlowy should use the Object Storage for storing your images and videos. Open up the AppFlowy Application on your local device and add an image in a random page.

![Add image to a random page in AppFlowy](images/image_appflowy.png)

You can now check in your Hetzner Cloud Console if the file got created in the Bucket.

## Conclusion

We have setup our own AppFlowy Cloud server using the Hetzner Object Storage.
