## Introduction

This tutorial will help you to create an SFTP-only user (without SSH access) on CentOS and RedHat systems. The user can connect to the server with SFTP access only, and is only allowed to access the specified directory. The user cannot SSH into the server. Follow the below tutorial to create this SFTP-only account.

**Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, make sure you are logged into your server with a `sudo` user.

## Step 1 - Create a New User

First, create a new user who will be granted only file transfer access to the server. Here, we're using the username **mysftp**, but you can use any username you like.

```bash
adduser mysftp
```

Next, assign a password to the new user:

```bash
passwd mysftp
```

Enter a strong password, and repeat it again to verify it.

You have now created a new user that will be granted access to the restricted directory. In the next step we will create the directory for file transfers and set up the necessary permissions.

## Step 2 - Create a Directory for File Transfers

Once our user is created, the next step is to create the directory where SFTP will act, preventing access and this must be configured with specific parameters.

We will create a directory called `/var/sftp/uploads` in which the `/var/sftp` is part of the root user, and no other user will have the current permissions, and in the subdirectory `/var/sftp/uploads` the owner will be the new user access. We create the directory using the following line:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/sftp/uploads
```

Set the owner of `/var/sftp` to **root**.

```bash
chown root:root /var/sftp
```

Give **root** write permissions to the same directory, and give other users only read and execute rights.

```bash
chmod 755 /var/sftp
```

Change the ownership on the `uploads` directory to **mysftp**.

```bash
chown mysftp:mysftp /var/sftp/uploads
```

## Step 3 - Restrict Directory Access

In this step we will restrict access via the terminal to the user, but allow the transfer of files.

Open the SSH server configuration file with `vi` or your favourite text editor:

```bash
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Scroll to the very bottom of the file and append the following configuration snippet:

```bash
Match User mysftp
ForceCommand internal-sftp
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChrootDirectory /var/sftp
PermitTunnel no
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no
```

Save and quit:

```bash
:wq
```

Execute the following command to apply the changes in SSH:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Step 4 - Verify SSH Connection

Let's ensure that our new **mysftp** user can only transfer files.

Logging in to the server as **mysftp** using normal shell access should no longer be possible. Let's try it:

```bash
ssh mysftp@localhost
```

You'll see the following message before being returned to your original prompt:

```bash
This service allows sftp connections only.
Connection to localhost closed.
```

This means that **mysftp** can no longer access the server shell using SSH.

Next, let's verify if the user can successfully access SFTP for file transfer.

```bash
sftp mysftp@localhost
```

Instead of an error message, this command will show a successful login message with an interactive prompt.

```bash
Connected to localhost.
sftp>
```

You can list the directory contents using `ls` in the prompt:

```bash
sftp> ls
```

This will show the `uploads` directory that was created in the previous step and return you to the `sftp>` prompt.

```bash
uploads
```

## Conclusion

You've created and restricted a user to SFTP-only access to a single directory on a server without giving them full shell access. While this tutorial uses only one directory and one user for brevity, you can extend this example to multiple users and multiple directories.
