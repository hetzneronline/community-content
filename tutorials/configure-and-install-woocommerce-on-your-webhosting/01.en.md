## What is WooCommerce?

**WooCommerce** is a popular, free WordPress plugin that allows you to transform your website into a fully-fledged online store.  
It offers features for product management, payments, shipping, and much more.  
In conjunction with a Hetzner web hosting plan, you can run WooCommerce easily and efficiently.

## Requirements

To install WooCommerce, you need:

- A **web hosting plan L or higher** (recommended: plan XL)
- An **active WordPress installation**
- A **database** that was already created during the WordPress installation
- **PHP 8.1** or higher
- A **secure HTTPS connection (SSL certificate)** – you can activate this directly via Hetzner SSL


## Step 1 – Logging in to Hetzner web hosting

1. Log in to the [Hetzner Accounts](https://accounts.hetzner.com) interface.
2. Select the appropriate **web hosting plan**.
3. Open **Websites & Domains** and click on your **domain** where WordPress is installed.


## Step 2 – Install WordPress (if you haven't already done so)

1. Open the WordPress item in the menu.
2. Select New Installation.
3. Fill in the required fields (domain, username, password, email).
4. Once you have completed this, you can log in to your WordPress dashboard at `https://deinedomain.de/wp-admin`.


## Step 3 – Install WooCommerce

1. Log in to the WordPress admin area.
2. Go to Plugins > Install.
3. Enter WooCommerce in the search bar.
4. Click on Install Now and then on Activate.


## Step 4 – WooCommerce setup wizard

After activation, the WooCommerce setup wizard will start automatically.

1. Enter your **business address** and currency.
2. Select which products you want to sell (physical, digital, or both).
3. Set up **shipping options** and **taxes**.
4. Select your **payment methods** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer).
5. Complete the setup and open the dashboard.


## Step 5 – Select a theme

WooCommerce works with most WordPress themes.

Recommended themes include:
- **Storefront** (official WooCommerce theme)
- **Astra**
- **OceanWP**

**Installation:**

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes > Add New**.
2. Search for your desired theme and click **Install**.
3. Activate the theme.


## Step 6 – Create products

3. Select **product categories**.
4. Save your product.


## Step 7 – Activate SSL (recommended)

SSL encryption is essential for the secure operation of your online shop.
1. Open **Domain Management** in your Hetzner web hosting panel.
2. Select your domain.
3. Under **SSL/TLS**, activate the **free Let’s Encrypt certificate**.
4. Then check in the WordPress admin under **Settings > General** that the URLs begin with `https://`.


## Step 8 – Performance and security

- Create **regular backups** using the Hetzner backup system or a plugin such as *UpdraftPlus*.
- Keep **WordPress, themes, and plugins up to date** to avoid security vulnerabilities.

### How do I update WooCommerce?
You can safely update plugins under **Dashboard > Updates**. Make sure to back up your site first.
