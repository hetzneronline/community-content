## Introduction

Having a firewall on your server is an extra step that you can take to increase security for your FreeBSD server.

This tutorial will show how to setup a firewall on FreeBSD 12 with the built in program `ipfw`; no extra software needs to be installed. Other firewalls like `pf` and `ipfilter` are also included by default in FreeBSD but this tutorial will focus solely on `ipfw`.

* It is assumed that you are running as the `root` user during this guide. Use `su` to change to `root` if you are not running as `root` already.

**Prerequisites**

* A FreeBSD 12 server with root access.

## Step 1 - Setting up IPFW

To start, edit the file `/etc/rc.conf` with a text editor of your preference.

Add the following lines to the file:

```
firewall_enable="YES"
firewall_quiet="YES"
firewall_type="workstation"
firewall_allowservices="any"
firewall_myservices="22/tcp"
firewall_logdeny="YES"
```
This will setup a firewall using `workstation` as the type of firewall, and denying access to all ports from outside hosts except for the default ssh port; port 22.

*If you have changed the default SSH port from 22 to something else, edit the above to reflect that change or you may lock yourself out of your server when you start the firewall. In case you did this, just reboot into a rescue system or LiveCD and edit `/etc/rc.conf`.*

Make sure to add any other ports or services (from `/etc/services`) that you need to access into `firewall_myservices`.

## Step 2 - Starting IPFW

To start the firewall, run the following command as root:

```
service ipfw start
```

IPFW should now be working and setup to start itself on boot, to check if it is working you may follow the next step.

## Step 3 - Checking Port with Nmap (Optional)

To test that IPFW is working correctly, you can use a program called `nmap`.

*This will need to be run from a different computer to the server with the firewall setup*

On most Linux & BSD systems `nmap` can be installed using the default package manager. Windows and macOS binaries can be downloaded from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html).

For example, to test if ports 22 and 80 are remotely accessible on the server's IP address of `10.0.0.1`

```
nmap -p 22,80 10.0.0.1
```

It will give an output similiar to this:

```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-06-15 12:00 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.1
Host is up (0.1s latency).

PORT   STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp open     ssh
80/tcp filtered http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.03 seconds
```
The above shows that port 22 is open and accessible, however port 80 is filtered and not accessible.

To scan for UDP ports on your server, just add the `-sU` option to your `nmap` scan.

## Conclusion

Congrats!! You should now have a working firewall on FreeBSD 12 that can help protect your server from unwanted intruders. For further configuration of IPFW, please look at the [IPFW documentation](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls-ipfw.html)
