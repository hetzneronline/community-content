## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to operate a Soketi WebSocket server behind an NGINX reverse proxy server, which will be protected by SSL encryption. The SSL certificate will be created using `Let's Encrypt` and is thus free. The renewal of this certificate is automated with the help of the command-line program acme.sh.

Official Documentation: [https://docs.soketi.app/](https://docs.soketi.app/)<br>
Project Website: [https://soketi.app/](https://soketi.app/)

**Prerequisites**

* Domain name (a subdomain is sufficient)
* Some experience with NodeJS and NPM
* A server (for example, with [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud))
  * Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04 as operating system
  * SSH key is recommended (see [this article](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key))
  * Access to the root user or a user with sudo permissions

**Example terminology**

* Domain: `ws.example.com`
* IPv4: `203.0.113.1`
* IPv6: `2001:db8:1234::1`

## Step 1 - Install updates and necessary packages

Connect to the server via SSH using your IP address.

Update package lists and install updates:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then restart the server to load any updated kernel.

Next, install all necessary packages:

* Install prerequisites
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git python3 gcc build-essential apparmor nginx
  ```

* Install NodeJS
  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  nvm install 18 && nvm use 18
  ```

* Install the two NodeJS packages `soketi` and `pm2`:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @soketi/soketi
  npm install -g pm2
  ```

## Step 2 - Create configuration for Soketi

Create a new configuration file:

```bash
nano ~/config.json
```

Add the following content and adjust it to your needs:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 6001,
  "appManager": {
    "driver": "array",
    "options": {
      "apps": [
        {
          "id": "my-app-id",
          "key": "my-app-key",
          "secret": "my-app-secret",
          "name": "My App",
          "enableClientMessages": true,
          "enableStatistics": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Save it with the key combination `CTRL`+`O`.

If this configuration file is used, no further configuration is required before the first start.

## Step 3 - First start of the Soketi server (without PM2)

Now start the Soketi server by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
soketi start --config="~/config.json"
```

## Step 4 - First test of the WebSocket server with Laravel 11

Make sure you have Laravel installed.

<blockquote>

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install php php-{mbstring,xml,bcmath,mysql} mariadb-server
cd ~ && php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php
echo 'alias composer="php ~/composer.phar"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel ~/example
cd ~/example
```

And setup a database:

```bash
sudo mysql
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure-password';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel.* TO 'laravel'@'localhost';
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE laravel;
MariaDB [(none)]> exit
```

Add the database information in the `~/example/.env` file:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=secure-password
```

Now run:

```bash
cd ~/example && php artisan migrate
```

</blockquote>

-------

Now, configure Soketi with Laravel.

</details>

<br>

Change the following values in the `~/example/.env` file:

> Add the same app ID, app key, and app secret, you also used in `~/config.json`.

```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=my-app-id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=my-app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=my-app-secret
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1
```

Check the settings in the file `~/example/config/broadcasting.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'connections' => [
        'pusher' => [
            'driver' => 'pusher',
            'key' => env('PUSHER_APP_KEY'),
            'secret' => env('PUSHER_APP_SECRET'),
            'app_id' => env('PUSHER_APP_ID'),
            'options' => [
                'cluster' => env('PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER'),
                'useTLS' => true,
            ],
        ],
        // other connections...
    ],
];
```

## Step 5 - Trigger first events

You can now send the first events with your WebSocket server.

## Step 6 - Configure auto-start for the Soketi server

To ensure the Soketi server starts automatically after a reboot of the server, we need to configure `pm2`:

Run the following commands:

```bash
pm2 start soketi --name WebSocket-Server -- start --config="~/config.json"
pm2 startup         # This activates the autostart. Follow the instructions on the screen.
```

## Step 7 - Set up reverse proxy

Now we need to set up the reverse proxy server. This will provide the SSL connection and then forward it to the soketi server. Create a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/soketi
```

Add the following content to the file:

> Replace `ws.example.com` with your own domain.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name ws.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/ws.example.com.cer;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ws.example.com.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6001;  # Replace the port if Soketi is running on a different port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ws.example.com;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
```

<blockquote>

*Replace `203.0.113.1` with your own IP address.*

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 203.0.113.1;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6001;  # Replace the port if soketi is running on a different port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

</blockquote>
</details>

<br>

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/soketi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/soketi
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default && sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 8 - Create SSL certificate

Before you create an SSL certificate, make sure you have DNS entries that point the IP addresses of you server to your domain name.

Your DNS configuration should look like this:

```shellsession
# Name              Type       Value
ws.example.com      IN A       203.0.113.1
ws.example.com      IN AAAA    2001:db8:1234::1
```

If `dig ws.example.com` shows the correct IP address, you can create the certificate. Propagation can take a while.

To create the certificate, we use the shell script `acme.sh`. Install it with the following command:

```bash
curl https://get.acme.sh | sh -s email=<your-email-address>
```

You will receive reminders at this email address when a certificate expires or if there are issues with renewal.

```bash
systemctl stop nginx && acme.sh --issue -d ws.example.com --standalone --server letsencrypt
acme.sh --install-cert -d ws.example.com --cert-file /etc/nginx/ssl/ws.example.com.cer --key-file /etc/nginx/ssl/ws.example.com.key --fullchain-file /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem --reloadcmd "systemctl reload nginx"
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Your WebSocket server is now equipped with SSL encryption. In the Laravel configuration, you need to change the port to `443`.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Soketi and setup an SSL certificate. When you access `ws.example.com` in a web browser, you should get "OK" which means that the web socket is available.
