## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to set up a Cloud HA cluster using keepalived and Floating IPs. The tutorials uses two servers as an example. If the first (original) server fails, the Floating IP is automatically assigned to the second server. As soon as the original server is available again, the Floating IP is automatically assigned back to the first server. This ensures that the web application is still available even if the server fails.

It should be noted that this form of high availability is not supported by all applications. This should be checked in the first place.

**Prerequisites**

+ Min. 2 cloud servers
+ One Floating IP

**Recommended**

> A separate cloud project should be created for the HA service, since **critical** access data must be stored in **clear text** on the servers.
> With a separate project, the damage can be minimized in the event of a possible compromise.

## Step 1 - Setting up automatic IP rerouting

This step is about automatic failover, where the Floating IP is automatically assigned to the other server, so that the service can operate under the same address.

### Step 1.1 - Creation of a Cloud API token

This token is required to control the Floating IP assignment from the server.
In the Cloud Console, a **read/write** API token must be created under **"Security"** Â» **"API tokens"**.

> **Note:** Since the token can only be read once, it is recommended to store it temporarily.

### Step 1.2 - Create a Cloud Network

For the `VRRP` Heartbeat, a private network channel is needed. For this, Cloud Networks are used.

You can create a Cloud Network in the Cloud Console under "Networks".

There, you can create a Network and assign it to the servers.

### Step 1.3 - Installing the IP Failover Software

In this step, the software responsible for provisioning the Floating IP is installed on both servers.

This is the open-source software [hcloud-ip](https://github.com/FootprintDev/hcloud-ip). To install the software, you can either use the prebuilt binaries or compile the software yourself.

**For an installation with the prebuilt binaries, the following steps are necessary**

```bash
wget -O /opt/hcloud-ip https://github.com/FootprintDev/hcloud-ip/releases/download/v0.0.1/hcloud-ip-linux64
chmod +x /opt/hcloud-ip
```

**To compile the software yourself, the following steps are necessary**

1. Installing the dependencies
   
   Ubuntu / Debian:
   ```bash
   apt install git wget
   ```
   
   CentOS / RHEL:
   ```bash
   yum install git wget
   ```
   
   Fedora:
   ```bash
   dnf instal git wget
   ```
   
   openSUSE / SLES:
   ```bash
   zypper install git wget
   ```

2. Golang installation
   ```bash
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar xfvz go1.21.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   export PATH=$(pwd)/go/bin:$PATH
   ```

3. Cloning the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FootprintDev/hcloud-ip /tmp/hcloud-ip && cd /tmp/hcloud-ip
   ```

4. Build the Project
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

Now there should be a program named `hcloud-ip` in the current folder. You can make it executable and save it respectively.

```bash
chmod +x hcloud-ip
mv hcloud-ip /opt
```

### Step 1.4 - Configuring the Floating IP

In order for the Floating IP to work on all servers in the event of a failover, you need to include it in the network configuration.
You can find instructions for this at [docs.hetzner.com](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/floating-ips/persistent-configuration).

## Step 2 - Setting up Keepalived

Keepalived is a Linux daemon that monitors systems or services and triggers a failover in case of an error. You need to install it on both servers.

### Step 2.1 - Installing Keepalived

Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
apt install keepalived
```

CentOS / RHEL:

```bash
yum install keepalived
```

Fedora:

```bash
dnf instal keepalived
```

openSUSE / SLES:

```bash
zypper install keepalived
```

### Step 2.2 - Enable Keepalived autostart

Systemd based systems:

```bash
systemctl enable keepalived
```

CentOS / RHEL

```bash
chkconfig keepalived on
```

### Step 2.3 - Configuration of Keepalived

The configuration shown here corresponds to an example using an HA web server (nginx).

**Configuration file on the master server**

`/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`

```conf
vrrp_script chk_nginx {
    script "/usr/bin/pgrep nginx"
    interval 2
    weight 101
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    interface [cloud_private_network_adapter]
    state MASTER
    priority 200

    virtual_router_id 30
    unicast_src_ip [master_private_IP]
    unicast_peer {
        [slave_private_IP]
    }

    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass [random_password]
    }

    track_script {
        chk_nginx
    }

    notify_master /etc/keepalived/failover.sh
}
```

> **Note:** The outlined values `[]` are to be replaced by your own specifications. For `auth_pass`, you can pick any random password. However, make sure to use the same password for the master and the slave.

**Configuration file on the slave server**

`/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`

```conf
vrrp_script chk_nginx {
    script "/usr/bin/pgrep nginx"
    interval 2
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    interface [cloud_private_network_adapter]
    state SLAVE
    priority 100

    virtual_router_id 30
    unicast_src_ip [slave_private_IP]
    unicast_peer {
        [master_private_IP]
    }

    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass [random_password]
    }

    track_script {
        chk_nginx
    }

    notify_master /etc/keepalived/failover.sh
}
```

> **Note:** The outlined values `[]` are to be replaced by your own specifications. For `auth_pass`, you can pick any random password. However, make sure to use the same password for the master and the slave.

**Contents of `failover.sh` on both servers**

`/etc/keepalived/failover.sh`

The script contains the actions that are to be executed in the event of a failover.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
IP='[Floating-IP-Name]'
TOKEN='[CloudToken]'

n=0
while [ $n -lt 10 ]
do
    if [ "$(/opt/hcloud-ip -ip "$IP" -key $TOKEN)" == "Server called $HOSTNAME was found" ]; then
        break
    fi
    n=$((n+1))
    sleep 3
done
```

> **Note:** The outlined values `[]` are to be replaced by your own specifications.

Make the `failover.sh` file executable:

```bash
chmod 755 /etc/keepalived/failover.sh
```

On systemd based systems, you can now start keepalived:

```bash
systemctl start keepalived
```

## Step 3 - Testing the configuration

In normal operation, the master web server handles all requests.

As soon as this fails, there is a failover to the slave web server.

As soon as the master web server is reachable again, it is switched back to.

## Conclusion

You should now have a High Availability Cloud environment.
