## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a Minecraft server on your VPS or dedicated servers.

**Prerequisites**

You need the following software before starting:
* `default-jre`
* `screen`

You can install these using this command:
```bash
sudo apt install default-jre screen -y
```

## Step 1 - Setting up files
You first need to create  directory for your Minecraft server files.

You can do that using the following command:
```bash
mkdir MinecraftServer && cd MinecraftServer
```
You can change **MinecraftServer** to anything you want

---

After you do that, you need to download your server JAR file.

You can use any JAR file you want,
however if you want to get the 1.17.1 vanilla server JAR, you can run this command:
```bash
wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a16d67e5807f57fc4e550299cf20226194497dc2/server.jar
```

## Step 2 - Starting your server

After you have created your Minecraft server folder
and have your server JAR file in it, you can
run the following command

```bash
screen -S MinecraftServer
```
You can replace the **MinecraftServer**
with anything you want.

This now should create a new screen, after
that you need to finally start your server.
You can run this command replacing the
**<MEMORY\>** to how much RAM
you want to give to your Minecraft
server in MB.

```bash
java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
```
You can also change the **server.jar**
with your actual server JAR that you have
in your Minecraft server folder.

So that would be the final command for example:
```bash
java -Xms512M -Xmx4000M -jar server.jar
```
*Remember to accept Mojang's EULA in __eula.txt__*

## Step 2.1 - Joining your server

It is simple to join your Minecraft server!
You can use your server's IP address to join your server. Example:
`<ServerIP>`

If you have changed your server port, you can use this IP:
`<ServerIP>:<Port>`

So you would type this for example:
`123.123.123.123:25565`

## Step 3 - Minimizing and maximizing your console

If you want to exit your console and do anything else, you can do this key combination:
`CTRL` + `A` then `D`

To return back to your server console, run the following command:
```bash
screen -r MinecraftServer
```
You can replace **MinecraftServer** to your actual screen name.

## Conclusion

You have created a Minecraft server, and you know how to access it's console, and you have successfuly joined it.
