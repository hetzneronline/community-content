## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a Minecraft server on your VPS or dedicated server.

This tutorial was tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

**Prerequisites**

* **One local device** » to connect to the game
* **One server** with Ubuntu » to host the game
  * You need access to the root user or a user with sudo permissions.
  * Before you start a game on the server, you should make at least some basic configuration, including a firewall. For more information, see:<br>[Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-initial-setup-ubuntu#introduction)

**Example terminology**

* `203.0.113.1` » Example public IP of the remote server
* `mcserver` » Example user on the remote server

## Step 1 - Setting up a user

It is not recommended to use the root user. Root users can unrestrictedly execute any command on the server. This can lead to accidental or unintentional changes. Creating a new user with sudo privileges can prevent such mistakes from happening.

Run this command to create a new user called "mcserver":

```bash
adduser mcserver
```

You will be asked to enter a password. Make sure to choose a secure one!

You can leave the rest empty.

```bash
Changing the user information for mcserver
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: 
	Room Number []: 
	Work Phone []: 
	Home Phone []: 
	Other []: 
```

You can now add the new user to the sudo group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo mcserver
```

Run this command to switch to the user "mcserver":

```bash
su - mcserver
```

## Step 2 - Getting the server ready

The default port for Minecraft servers is `25565`. To run Minecraft, you need Java.

For this reason, you need to:

* [Enable port 25565](#step-21---enabling-port-25565)
* [Install Java](#step-22---installing-java)

### Step 2.1 - Enabling port 25565

If you have a firewall on your server, make sure it allows port 25565 TCP and UDP so that your local device can connect to the game hosted on your server.

There are several different firewall tools. This tutorial covers:

<details>

<summary>UFW » Default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu</summary>

* **View current firewall settings**<br>
  To check if the `ufw` firewall is active and if you already have any rules, you can use:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status
  ```
  > Example output:
  > ```console
  > mcserver@ubuntu-server:~# ufw status
  > Status: active
  > 
  > To                         Action      From
  > --                         ------      ----
  > OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
  > OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  > ```

* **Allow port 25565 TCP and UDP**<br>
  If the firewall is active, run these commands to allow incoming traffic to port 25565 TCP and UDP:  
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow proto tcp to any port 25565
  sudo ufw allow proto udp to any port 25565
  ```

* **View new firewall settings**<br>
  The new rules should now be added. To check, use:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status
  ```
  > Example output:
  > ```console
  > mcserver@ubuntu-server:~# sudo ufw status
  > Status: active
  > 
  > To                         Action      From
  > --                         ------      ----
  > OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
  > 25565/tcp                  ALLOW       Anywhere
  > 25565/udp                  ALLOW       Anywhere
  > OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  > 25565/tcp (v6)             ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  > 25565/udp (v6)             ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  > ```

<details>

<summary>Hetzner Cloud Firewall</summary>

This is only relevant if your remote server is a Hetzner Cloud server and you have a Hetzner Cloud Firewall applied to it. To edit your Firewall rules, open [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects) and select your Firewall. In the Firewall menu "Rules", add the following "inbound" rules:

| IPs                                     |Protocol| Port  |Port range|
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| <kbd>Any IPv4</kbd> <kbd>Any IPv6</kbd> | TCP    | 25565 |          |
| <kbd>Any IPv4</kbd> <kbd>Any IPv6</kbd> | UDP    | 25565 |          |

-------

</details>

**Note:** If you're using a different firewall, make sure it allows **incoming traffic** to port 25565 TCP and UDP.

### Step 2.2 - Installing Java

To start Minecraft, you need to have Java installed on your server.

* Check if Java is already installed
  ```bash
  java --version
  ```
* Install Java
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-19-jdk-headless openjdk-19-jre-headless -y
  ```
  To check if the installation worked, you can use `java --version` again.

## Step 3 - Installing Minecraft

Now that the port is open and Java is installed, you can install Minecraft itself. The server release of Minecraft is available at:

* [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) <kbd>recommended</kbd>
  * `minecraft_server.1.20.4.jar`
* [papermc.io](https://papermc.io/downloads) ([old versions](https://papermc.io/downloads/all))
  * `paper-1.20.4-436.jar`

-----------------

To install Minecraft, do the following:

* **Create a new directory for the Minecraft files and open it**
  ```bash
  mkdir MinecraftServer && cd MinecraftServer
  ```

<br>

* **Go to minecraft.net or papermc.io**<br>
  Choose a version and copy the link to the JAR file. You can use `wget` and the copied link to save the file on your server. Pick **one** of the options below, do not run both commands:
  * minecraft.net
    ```bash
    wget https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/8dd1a28015f51b1803213892b50b7b4fc76e594d/server.jar
    ``` 
  * papermc.io
    ```bash
    wget -O server.jar https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20.4/builds/436/downloads/paper-1.20.4-436.jar
    ```  
  
  > This will download `v1.20.4`. If you want to install a different version, you can replace the link in the example command with the link you copied.
  
  Use `ls -al` to check if the file is now available on your server. You should only have one JAR file on your server. If you downloaded both JAR files, you can delete one of them.

<br>

* **Accept the EULA**<br>
  Starting your Minecraft server for the first time will fail. This is because you need to accept the Mojang EULA in the **eula.txt** file. Start the server:
  ```bash
  java -jar server.jar
  ```
  > Make sure to execute this command within the directory in which you saved the JAR file.
  
  Use `ls -al` to check if `eula.txt` is now in your directory. Edit the file:
  ```bash
  nano eula.txt
  ```
  Change `eula=false` to `eula=true` to accept their EULA and use `ctrl`+`X`, followed by `Y`, followed by `Enter` to save the file.

## Step 4 - Starting your server

Now that everything is ready, you can start the game. If you start the Minecraft server in a normal terminal session, the game will end as soon as you end the connection to your remote server. One way to keep the game running is to use the `screen` tool. **Screen** allows you to start separate virtual terminal sessions in one remote terminal session.

When you end your remote terminal session, the virtual terminal session (screen session) will stay open. When you start a new remote terminal session, you will see that the screen session is still there.

<blockquote>

<details>

<summary>Install screen</summary>

If you don't have screen installed yet, you can install it now with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install screen -y
```

---------

</details>

</blockquote>


To start a Minecraft game in a screen session, do the following:

* **Start the session**
  ```bash
  screen -S MinecraftServer
  ```
  > You can replace `MinecraftServer` with any other name for your screen.

* **Go to the Minecraft directory**<br>
  Open the directory in which you saved the server JAR file of Minecraft. If you used the example path from this tutorial, you can open it with:
  ```bash
  cd ~/MinecraftServer
  ```

* **Start Minecraft**<br>
  You can run this command replacing `<MEMORY>` with the maximum RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server in MB. You need to leave extra memory on your server, so do **not** use the entire RAM. You can use `free -h` to check the total memory.
  * Without flags
    ```bash
    java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
    ```
  * With [recommended JVM startup flags](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags#recommended-jvm-startup-flags)
    ```bash
    java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -Dusing.aikars.flags=https://mcflags.emc.gs -Daikars.new.flags=true -jar server.jar
    ```
  
  <br>
  
  > * `-Xms` » minimum RAM the Minecraft server gets (`512M`)
  > * `-Xmx` » maximum RAM the Minecraft server gets (`<MEMORY>M`)
  
  You should now be in the Minecraft console where you can enter Minecraft commands.

  You can use `/list` to test if it is working:

  ```bash
  [09:08:10] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (64.773s)! For help, type "help"
  /list
  [09:09:03] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 0 of a max of 20 players online:
  ```

## Step 5 - Managing the screen session

You can use the key combination `ctrl`+`A` followed by `D` to exit the screen session. This will not end the screen session and the game will continue to run.

To go back to the Minecraft screen session or to make any other changes, you can use these commands:

* List all screens
  ```bash
  screen -list
  ```
  > The screen you just created should also be listed here.

* Go back to your running screen session
  ```bash
  screen -dr MinecraftServer
  ```
  > If you used a different name, replace `MinecraftServer` with your screen name.

* Delete the screen session<br>
  ```bash
  screen -X -S MinecraftServer quit
  ```
  > **Note:** This will end the Minecraft game and the screen session will no longer be available.

## Step 5 - Using a different port

By default, the Minecraft game is always started on port 25565. To start a game on a different port, follow the steps below. 

If you're still in your `MinecraftServer` screen session, use `stop` to end the current Minecraft server. If you want to start a second game in another screen session, you can use the key combination `ctrl`+`A` followed by `D` to exit the `MinecraftServer` screen session and create a new screen session. Each server JAR file is used for one Minecraft game. To start a second game in another screen session, you need to download the Minecraft server JAR file a second time. You should save the new file in a separate directory. You should also make sure that your server has enough RAM to host two games.

* **Open the `server.properties` file**<br>
  You can edit the port in the `server.properties` file. The file is in the same directory as your Minecraft server JAR file.
  
  Edit the `server.properties` file:
  ```bash
  nano server.properties
  ```

* **Change the port**<br>
  Go to the line `server-port=25565` and change the port:  
  ```bash
  server-port=25567
  ```
  > If you want to use another port, remove `25567` and enter your port.

  Use `ctrl`+`X`, followed by `Y`, followed by `Enter` to save your changes and to exit the file.

* **Start a new game**<br>
  * Without flags
    ```bash
    java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
    ```
  * With [recommended JVM startup flags](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags#recommended-jvm-startup-flags)
    ```bash
    java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -Dusing.aikars.flags=https://mcflags.emc.gs -Daikars.new.flags=true -jar server.jar
    ```
  
  <br>
  
  > Replace `<MEMORY>` with the maximum RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server.

* **Update your firewall**<br>
  If you have a firewall, make sure it allows the port you just set for the game, in this example port 25567. For `ufw` and Hetzner Cloud Firewall, you can follow the steps described in "[Step 2.1](#step-21---enabling-port-25565)".

## Step 6 - Auto-restarting your server

You can create a script to auto-restart the server if it crashes.

If you left the Minecraft screen session, use `screen -dr MinecraftServer` to go back.

You can use the Minecraft command `stop` to end your Minecraft server.

Enter the command below to save a new shell script in the same path as your Minecraft server JAR file, in this example the `~/MinecraftServer` directory.

> Replace `<MEMORY>` with the maximum RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server.

```bash
cat <<'EOF' >> ~/MinecraftServer/run.sh
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
	java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
    for i in 3 2 1; do
    	echo "The server will restart in $i second(s), CTRL-C to cancel."
        sleep 1
    done
done

EOF
```

To make the script executable, run this command:

```bash
chmod +x ~/MinecraftServer/run.sh
```

Finally, start the Minecraft server:

```bash
./run.sh
```

If the Minecraft server crashes, it will automatically restart.

## Step 7 - Joining your server

It is simple to join your Minecraft server!

On your local device, open the Minecraft Launcher and select `Multiplayer` » `Add Server`.
You can use your server's IP address to join your server.

If you used the default port, you do not need to specify the port. If you used a different port, you should add the port at the end of the IP address separated by a colon: `<server-ip>:<port>`, e.g. `203.0.113.1:25567`

If you are hosting the Minecraft server locally, you can use: `localhost:<port>`

## Conclusion

You successfully created a Minecraft server and you know how to access its console. Next, you can edit the `server.properties` file to set up some custom settings. The file is in the same repository as your Minecraft server JAR file. To optimize performance, you can add the [recommended JVM startup flags](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags#recommended-jvm-startup-flags) when you start your Minecraft server.
