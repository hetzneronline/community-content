## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to set up your own **Minecraft server** on a Hetzner Cloud Server.
Tested on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (as of October 2025)

**Prerequisites**
* **A local device** – to connect to the game
* **A Hetzner Cloud Server** with Ubuntu to host Minecraft
* Access as **root** or a user with **sudo** privileges  
  * Basic configuration, including firewall, should be complete
→ [Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-initial-setup-ubuntu#introduction)

**Example terminology**
* `203.0.113.1` – Public IP address of your server
* `mcserver` – Example user on the server


## Step 1 – Create a new user
It is not recommended to work as **root** permanently.
Instead, create a user with sudo privileges:

```bash
adduser mcserver
usermod -aG sudo mcserver
su - mcserver
```

Choose a secure password. You can leave the rest of the information blank.

## Step 2 – Prepare the server

Minecraft requires Java and port 25565.

### Step 2.1 – Open port 25565

If you are using UFW, activate the rules:

```bash
sudo ufw allow proto tcp to any port 25565
sudo ufw allow proto udp to any port 25565
sudo ufw reload
sudo ufw status
```

If you are using the Hetzner Cloud Firewall:

| Direction | Protocol | Port | Source |
| --------- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Inbound | TCP | 25565 | Any IPv4 / IPv6 |
| Inbound | UDP | 25565 | Any IPv4 / IPv6 |

You can enter this in the [Hetzner Console](https://console.hetzner.com) under Firewalls → Rules.

### Step 
2.2 – Install Java 21

Minecraft 1.21.1 requires Java 17 or newer. Ubuntu 24.04 provides OpenJDK 21 LTS:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk-headless -y
java --version
```

## Step 3 – Install Minecraft Server

Create a directory for the server:

```bash
mkdir ~/mcraftserver
cd ~/mcraftserver
```

Download the latest server file – either officially from Mojang or PaperMC (recommended):

PaperMC (recommended):

```bash
wget -O server.jar https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.21.1/builds/120/downloads/paper-1.21.1-120.jar
```

Official (Mojang):

```bash
wget -O server.jar https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/0d03b59cc3e1eecbcb5b0b6f0c79e6a19c6b01ce/server.jar
```

**Accept EULA**
Start the server once to generate the EULA:

```bash
java -jar server.jar
```

Then edit the file:

```bash
nano eula.txt
```

Change:
```
eula=false
```

to
```
eula=true
```

Save with Ctrl + X, Y, Enter.

## Step 4 – Start Minecraft Server

Install the screen tool to run the server in the background:

```bash
sudo apt install screen -y
screen -S MinecraftServer
```

Change to your server directory:

```bash
cd ~/MinecraftServer
```
Start the server (replace <MEMORY> with, for example, 4096 for 4 GB RAM):

With recommended JVM flags:

```bash
java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -jar server.jar nogui
```

Example:
```bash
java -Xms512M -Xmx4096M -jar server.jar nogui
```

As soon as you see the message:

```
[Server thread/INFO]: Done (X.XXXs)! For help, type “help”
```
the server has started.

## Step 5 – Manage screen session

*  Exit session: Ctrl + A, then D
*  Display all sessions:
```bash
screen -list
```
*  Return to session:
```bash
screen -r mcraftserver
```
*  End session:
```bash
screen -X -S mcraftserver quit
```

## Step 6 – Change server port

If you want to start multiple servers:
```bash
nano server.properties
```
Change
```
server-port=25565
```
e.g. to:
```
server-port=25567
```
Then adjust your firewall rules.

## Step 7 – Set up automatic restart

Create a start script that automatically restarts the server in case of a crash:

```bash
cat <<‘EOF’ > ~/mcraftserver/run.sh
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  java -Xms512M -Xmx4096M -jar server.jar nogui
  echo “Server will restart in 5 seconds – CTRL+C to cancel.”
sleep 5
done
EOF
chmod +x ~/mcraftserver/run.sh
```

Start the server with the script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Step 8 – Connect to the server

Start Minecraft → Multiplayer → Add Server
Enter the following address:
```
<your-server-ip>
```
or with port:
```
<your-server-ip>:<port> 
```
Example:
```
203.0.113.1:25567
```
If you are playing locally:
```
localhost:25565
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up your own Minecraft server on a Hetzner Cloud Server.
You can now make further adjustments in the server.properties file, install plugins via PaperMC, or set up automatic backups.
For better performance, we recommend using PaperMC's [JVM optimizations](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags/).
