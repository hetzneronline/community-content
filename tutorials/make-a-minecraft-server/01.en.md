## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create a Minecraft server on your VPS or dedicated servers.

This tutorial was tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.

**Prerequisites**

You need the following software before starting:

* `screen`
* `nano` (or your favourite text editor)
* You will also need to install Java.

 **1.8.X -> 1.16.X** `openjdk-8-jre-headless`

 **1.17.X** `openjdk-16-jre-headless`

 **1.18.X** `openjdk-17-jre-headless`

You can install `screen` using this command:

```bash
sudo apt install screen -y
```

And you can install Java using this command replacing the `JAVA` with the one specified above.

```bash
sudo apt install JAVA -y
```

Example: `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y`

## Step 1- Setting up user

We first need to create a new user to run our Minecraft server on.

You can run this command to create a new user.

```bash
sudo adduser mcserver
```

You will be asked to enter a password. Make sure to choose a secure one!

Then, you may leave these empty.

```bash
Changing the user information for mcserver
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: 
	Room Number []: 
	Work Phone []: 
	Home Phone []: 
	Other []: 
```

To login to our new user and go to our home directory, we run:

```bash
su mcserver
cd ~
```

## Step 2 - Setting up files

You need to create  directory for your Minecraft server files.

You can do that using the following command:

```bash
mkdir MinecraftServer && cd MinecraftServer
```

---

After you do that, you need to download your server JAR file.

You can use this command to download the vanilla server JAR replacing the `VERSION` with the version you want

```bash
curl -o server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/vanilla/VERSION
```

Example: `curl -o server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/vanilla/1.18.1`

If you would like to use Paper (recommended), you can run this command replacing the `VERSION` with the version you want

```bash
curl -o server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/paper/VERSION
```

Example: `curl -o server.jar https://serverjars.com/api/fetchJar/paper/1.18.1`

## Step 3 - Starting your server

After you have created your Minecraft server folder and have your server JAR file in it, you can run the following command

```bash
screen -S MinecraftServer
```

This now should create a new screen, after that you need to finally start your server.
You can run this command replacing the **<MEMORY\>** to how much RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server in MB.

```bash
java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
```

You can also change the **server.jar** with your actual server JAR that you have in your Minecraft server folder.

Example: `java -Xms512M -Xmx4096M -jar server.jar`

Starting your server for the first time will fail, this is because you need to accept the Mojang EULA in the **eula.txt** file.

To do that, run:

```bash
nano eula.txt
```

And change the `eula=false` part to `eula=true` if you accept their EULA.

### Step 3.1 - Joining your server

It is simple to join your Minecraft server!
You can use your server's IP address to join your server. Example:
`<ServerIP>`

If you have changed your server port, you can use this IP:
`<ServerIP>:<Port>`

So you would type this for example:
`123.123.123.123:25565`

If you are hosting this locally, it would be: `localhost:<Port>`

## Step 4 - Auto restart your server

We can create a script to auto restart our server if it crashes.

You can stop your Minecraft server using the `stop` command.

After that, run:

```bash
nano run.sh
```

After running this command, copy this script and paste it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
	java -Xms512M -Xmx<MEMORY>M -jar server.jar
    for i in 3 2 1; do
    	echo "The server will restart in $i second(s), CTRL-C to cancel."
        sleep 1
    done
done
```

Replace the **<MEMORY\>** to how much RAM you want to give to your Minecraft server in MB.

After that, click `CTRL-S` to save the file then `CTRL-X` to exit.

To make our script runnable, run this command:

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

And finally, run `./run.sh` and your server will auto restart.

## Step 5 - Minimizing and maximizing your console

If you want to exit your console and do anything else, you can do this key combination:

`CTRL` + `A` then `D`

To return back to your server console, run the following command:

```bash
screen -r MinecraftServer
```

And to login back to your user, run:

```bash
su mcserver
```

## Conclusion

You have created a Minecraft server, and you know how to access it's console, and you have successfully joined it.
