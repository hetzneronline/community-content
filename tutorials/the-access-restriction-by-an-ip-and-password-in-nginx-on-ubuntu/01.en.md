## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to restrict access to the `server` and `location` in the nginx configuration. This tutorial will show you how to restrict access by using IP addresses of clients and a pair of username and password. This can be useful if you want to add an additional protection for your web server. For example you can restrict access to the admin area of your website only to the list of trusted IPs. You can also implement geo-based restrictions by using the IP databases. You can require username and password for access too.

**Prerequisites**

* Configured Ubuntu server and a user with the sudo privileges (you can follow [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-initial-setup-ubuntu)).
* Installed nginx (you can follow [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04)).
* Basic understanding of nginx and its configuration. You can follow the [official tutorial](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).
* For the password-based restriction you need to enable HTTPS for your `server`. You can follow [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/add-ssl-certificate-with-lets-encrypt-to-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04).

**Example terminology**

* IPv4: 10.0.0.1
* IPv4: 10.0.0.5
* Domain: example.com

Please replace `10.0.0.5` with an IP of your local computer, `10.0.0.1` with an IP of your server and `example.com` with your own domain in all example commands.

**Formatting conventions**

* In some configuration examples the ellipsis `...` is used to indicate that part of the configuration is omitted.

* server vs. `server`

  * server is your Ubuntu server where nginx is installed.

  * `server` on the other hand is the block in the nginx configuration file which looks like this:

    ```nginx
    server {
        ...
    }
    ```

**Configuration places**

You need to know where nginx stores its configuration.

* `/etc/nginx` is the nginx configuration directory. All configuration files are placed there. This directory is used for the relative paths in the `include` directive.

* `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` is the main nginx configuration file. nginx starts reading its configuration here.

* `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` is the directory where you can place your HTTP(S) `server` configuration files. After nginx is started or reloaded all files from there will be loaded by nginx. This works because the main file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` contains the directive `include sites-enabled/*;`. Files are loaded in alphabetical order.

* `/etc/nginx/sites-available` is the directory where you can place your HTTP(S) `server` configuration files, but they will not be loaded by nginx. A configuration file in this directory can be activated by creating a symbolic link in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory. For example:

  ```bash
  ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
  ```
  enables the configuration file `example.com`. After the next startup or reload nginx will load this file.

**Log files**

Log files are useful when you need to troubleshoot something. There are two log files by default:

* `/var/log/nginx/access.log` is the file where nginx logs all requests. The format of this log file is called `combined` and is explained [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#log_format).

* `/var/log/nginx/error.log` is the file where nginx logs all error conditions and status information.

**Error on reload**

If you are trying to reload your configuration with command `sudo systemctl reload nginx` and nginx
complains that you made a mistake, you can see the precise error by running `sudo nginx -t`.

## Step 1 - Determining the right configuration file to modify

You need to find the nginx configuration file of the `server` you want to modify.
If your `server` to which you want to add restrictions responds to requests like these:

```bash
curl http://example.com
```

where `example.com` is your domain or an IP of your server, then you need to find the `server` block with `server_name example.com;`:

```nginx
server {
    ...
    server_name example.com;
    ...
}
```

The `listen` directive should be `listen 80;` or `listen 10.0.0.1:80;` (where `10.0.0.1` is an IP of your server) for HTTP,
and `listen 443 ssl;` or `listen 10.0.0.1:443 ssl;` for HTTPS.
For the `curl` example above configuration should be similar to this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    ...
}
```

If you can't find the `server` with appropriate `server_name` this means that default server for the listen port is used. In this case you need to find a `server` block with `listen` directive that corresponds to the request port, that either appears first in the nginx configuration or contains the `listen` directive marked as default, like this: `listen 80 default_server;`.

After the configuration of the `server` is found you can start adding restrictions to your `server`.

## Step 2 - Using IP addresses of clients to allow or deny access

nginx provides `allow` and `deny` directive to allow and block access for clients by using their IP addresses.
For testing purposes, you can block access to yourself.

Before doing so, first you need to check that you can access your `server` by running this command on your **local computer**:

* Replace `example.com` with `server_name` of the `server` you want to configure and `http` with `https` if necessary.

* The combination of the domain (or an IP) and port (in this example port `80` is used, because it is the default for HTTP) must correspond to the nginx `server_name` and `listen` directive.

```bash
curl -4 --head http://example.com
```

You should get the output similar to this, with the HTTP status `200`:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2023 13:22:45 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
```

### Step 2.1 - Finding out your public IP address

You need to know the public IP address of your **local computer** to block it in nginx. You can run this command to determine it:

```bash
curl -4 https://2ip.io
```

Your IP address will be outputted to the terminal, for example: `10.0.0.5`.

* If the curl command above doesn't work try this [Google search query](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+ip) you should see your public IP right in the search results.

* If nginx is listening only on a local port you need to use your local IP instead of the public one.

### Step 2.2 - Blocking access

You need to add this line to the appropriate `location` in your `server` block:

```nginx
deny 10.0.0.5;
```

Where `10.0.0.5` is your public IP. 

The complete configuration may look like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        deny 10.0.0.5;
    }
}
```

To apply your changes, reload the nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now let's try to run the same command from the introduction of this step:

```bash
curl -4 --head http://example.com
```

This time output must be like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: nginx
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2023 08:27:58 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 162
Connection: keep-alive
```

HTTP status `403` means that access is denied.

In the nginx error log `/var/log/nginx/error.log` you should see an error like this:

```log
2023/03/20 17:59:25 [error] 25216#1896: *18 access forbidden by rule, client: 10.0.0.5, server: example.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "10.0.0.1"
```

where `10.0.0.5` is an IP of the blocked client and `example.com` is a value of the `server_name` directive.

Congratulations! You blocked access to yourself. To rollback your changes you need to remove the `deny` directive and reload the nginx configuration.

Multiple `allow` and `deny` directives can be specified. The first that matches will be used.
The two special directives `allow all;` and `deny all;` are provided, which match always and should be placed at the bottom of the `allow` / `deny` list.
For example:

```nginx
    allow 10.0.0.5;
    allow 10.0.0.6;
    deny all;
```

allow access to `10.0.0.5` and `10.0.0.6` and block everybody else.

The complete configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        allow 10.0.0.5;
        allow 10.0.0.6;
        deny all;
    }
}
```

If your `server` listens on IPv6 ports make sure to `allow` or `deny` IPv6 addresses too.

You can place the list of `deny` and `allow` directives in the `server` context:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    allow 10.0.0.5;
    allow 10.0.0.6;
    deny all;
    location / {
    }
}
```

In this case the child `location` will inherit the list of `allow` and `deny` directives.
But if you specify at least one `deny` or `allow` directive in the `location` context, all the list of `allow` and `deny` directives from the parent will be ignored, for example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    allow 10.0.0.5;
    allow 10.0.0.6;
    deny all;
    location / {
        deny 10.0.0.7;
    }
}
```

In the `location` only `10.0.0.7` is blocked, everybody else is allowed.
The list of `allow` and `deny` directives from the parent is ignored.

Instead of IP address, subnet can be used like this:

```nginx
    allow 10.0.0.0/24;
    deny all;
```

Do not forget to reload the configuration after your modifications by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Attention!**

If you have configuration like this:

* `location /` and `location /admin` are the prefix locations
* `location ~ \.php$` is the regular expression location

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
    location /admin {
        allow 10.0.0.5;
        allow 10.0.0.6;
        deny all;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        include fastcgi.conf;
    }
}
```

**request to `/admin/index.php` will be unprotected!**

The longest prefix `location` that matches is remembered by nginx and will be used to process request but only if no regular expression `location` matches.

The regular expression `location`s are marked with tilde `~`. They are checked by nginx after prefix `location`s inside out and from top to bottom, and first that matches will be used to process request.

Hence the regular expression `location` must be defined separately for the protected prefix `location`, like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
    location /admin {
        allow 10.0.0.5;
        allow 10.0.0.6;
        deny all;
        location ~ \.php$ {
            try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
            include fastcgi.conf;
        }
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        include fastcgi.conf;
    }
}
```

`/admin/index.php` is protected in this configuration.

If you don't like duplication you can put the common parts into the file and include it. In this example the file `/etc/nginx/php.conf` can be created with directives:

```nginx
try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
include fastcgi.conf;
```

Now it can be included:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
    location /admin {
        allow 10.0.0.5;
        allow 10.0.0.6;
        deny all;
        location ~ \.php$ {
            include php.conf;
        }
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include php.conf;
    }
}
```

## Step 3 - Using the geo module as an alternative to allow and deny

As a more flexible alternative to the `allow` and `deny` directive, the nginx module `geo` can be used.
The `geo` module lets you create a variable with a value that depends on a client IP address. This variable can be used later in request processing.
This mechanism is not specifically for restricting access, but can be used as such. Let's return to our example from the previous chapter which uses `allow` and `deny`
and which allows the two IP addresses and blocks others.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        allow 10.0.0.5;
        allow 10.0.0.6;
        deny all;
    }
}
```

This example can be translated to use the `geo` module:

```nginx
geo $not_allowed {
    10.0.0.5  0;
    10.0.0.6  0;
    default   1;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        if ($not_allowed) {
            return 403 "You're not allowed to access. Your IP is $remote_addr";
        }
    }
}
```

This approach is a little more flexible as you can see. You can set any HTTP status code by changing `403` to somethings else,
and you can show the message to the blocked client, the message can contain variables.

* In contrast to the `deny` directive you will not see anything in `error.log` when the user is blocked. As with other requests it will be logged to `access.log`.

* If you want to use `return` then you need to use `geo` with `if` instead of `allow` and `deny`.

  `allow` and `deny` will not work with `return`, because `return` is executed earlier than `allow` and `deny`, and the result will be returned regardless if a user is allowed to access.

## Step 4 - Configuring restrictions based on the geographical location

**Requirements:**

* Ubuntu 20.04 or later.

* nginx is installed from the Ubuntu repositories.

  If you installed nginx from [third-party repositories provided by nginx project](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html) this instruction will not work, because their repositories don't provide the required dynamic module.

First of all you need to install the nginx dynamic module `geoip2` which adds support for the IP databases with geographical information. The database will be queried to determine the country of the user by their IP. This information in turn will be used to allow or block access.

Install the required package:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-geoip2
```

By default at the beginning of the file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, and outside of any curly brackets you must have the uncommented line:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
```

If it's not the case, you need to add or uncomment it.

Alternatively you can load only `geoip2` module like this:

```nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_geoip2_module.so;
```

Reload the nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now you only have the `geoip2` module, this is not enough to start enabling restrictions.

You need to download the `geoip2` compatible IP database that can be used to check the country of a user. You can do it by running this command:

```bash
cd /etc/nginx && sudo curl --fail -LO https://github.com/P3TERX/GeoLite.mmdb/releases/latest/download/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
```

Alternatively you can [create an account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup?lang=en) on the MaxMind website and download the GeoLite2 Country database from there:

1. Open the [registration form](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup?lang=en) in your browser and fill it.
2. You will receive an email with the link to create your password.
3. [Log in](https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/login) with your email and password.
4. Go to `Account / Manage License Keys` and create a new license key. Copy your license key and save it somewhere.
5. Now you can download the GeoLite2 Country database by running this command:

    * replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your license key

    * database is saved to the file `/etc/nginx/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`

    ```bash
    cd /etc/nginx && sudo curl --fail -o GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoLite2-Country&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=tar.gz" && sudo tar --strip-components=1 -xzf GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz --wildcards "*.mmdb" && sudo rm GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz
    ```

Now you need to edit your nginx configuration to add the `geoip2` directive which loads the database into nginx. After the database is loaded it can be used to block or allow access.
The complete configuration may look like this:

```nginx
geoip2 /etc/nginx/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb {
    $user_country country iso_code;
}

map $user_country $not_allowed {
    CA       1;
    US       1;
    default  0;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        if ($not_allowed) {
            return 403 "You're not allowed to access.";
        }
    }
}
```

* `geoip2` directive is used to specify the path to an IP database and to define variables.
  In the example above the variable `$user_country` is defined.
  When the request is processed by nginx this variable is set to the user country's two-letter code.

* `map` directive is used to create the boolean variable `$not_allowed`, value of which is chosen according to the `$user_country` variable, defined in the `geoip2` block.
  In this example configuration the users from United States and Canada are blocked, users from other countries are allowed. The two-letter country codes which can be used inside the `map` are listed [on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).

* Finally the `$not_allowed` variable is used inside the `if` statement to block or allow a request.

* More information about the `geoip2` module can be found on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module).

## Step 5 - Password-based authentication

You can allow access only to users with a password. This is called HTTP Basic authentication. You need to setup HTTPS for your `server` first, to prevent sending your username and password in clear text.
You can use [this tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/add-ssl-certificate-with-lets-encrypt-to-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) to do that.
The configuration you will end up with will be similar to this:

```nginx
server {
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

After you have configured HTTPS, you can setup the password-based authentication.
First of all the special file needs to be created where all usernames and corresponding passwords are stored.
You can create it like this:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/nginx/users
```

Users can be added by this command:

* Follow the prompts, if you made a mistake you can cancel the command by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

* Note that this command uses `sudo` and may ask for your password, this is not password for the new user.

```bash
python3 -c 'from subprocess import *; import sys; print("Username: ", end="", file=sys.stderr); user = input();
passwd = run(["openssl", "passwd", "-6"], encoding="utf-8", stdout=PIPE).stdout.strip();
print("Username or password is empty. Try again!", file=sys.stderr) if user == "" or passwd == "" else print(user + ":" + passwd)' | sudo tee -a /etc/nginx/users
```

Above command will add the user to the `/etc/nginx/users` file, and additionally output the username and hash of the password separated by colon `:` to your terminal.
The password itself is not stored on the server.

More users can be added to `/etc/nginx/users` by repeating the same `python3` command above.
You can manually edit `/etc/nginx/users` to remove users. Each user is on a separate line.

The special file with users is created and now you can modify your `server` block.
The two directives: `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_user_file` needs to be added to your `server` configuration.
The resulting configuration will look like this:

```nginx
server {
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
    auth_basic "Protected area!";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/users;

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

Reload nginx to apply your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

New configuration can be tested with `curl`:

* Without username and password:

  ```bash
  curl --verbose https://example.com
  ```

  In this case you should get HTTP status `401` and no requested content. Response headers will look like these:

  ```
  < HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  < Server: nginx
  < Date: Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:13:54 GMT
  < Content-Type: text/html
  < Content-Length: 179
  < Connection: keep-alive
  < WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Protected area!"
  ```

* With username and password:

  Replace `user` with your username and `password` with your password created using the `python3` command above, and `example.com` with your domain.

  ```bash
  curl --verbose -u user:password https://example.com
  ```

  This time you should get HTTP status `200` and the requested content. Response headers will look like these:
  
  ```
  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  < Server: nginx
  < Date: Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:06:12 GMT
  < Content-Type: text/html
  < Content-Length: 615
  < Last-Modified: Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:48:42 GMT
  < Connection: keep-alive
  < ETag: "6418724a-267"
  < Accept-Ranges: bytes
  ```

If somebody used the wrong password it will be logged to the `/var/log/nginx/error.log` like this:

```log
2023/03/28 12:06:49 [error] 1865#1865: *14 user "holu": password mismatch, client: 10.0.0.5, server: example.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "example.com"
```

If somebody used the username which doesn't exist in the `/etc/nginx/users` file it will be logged to the `error.log` like this:

```log
2023/03/28 12:08:21 [error] 1865#1865: *16 user "root" was not found in "/etc/nginx/users", client: 10.0.0.5, server: example.com, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "example.com"
```

You can restrict access to the `location` context by placing there `auth_basic` and `auth_basic_user_file`. For example:

```nginx
server {
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    }
    location /admin {
        auth_basic "Protected area!";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/users;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```

`location /admin` is protected here by password-based authentication.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this tutorial was useful to you and you learned something new. nginx can be tricky to configure, the [official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) and [mailing list archives](https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo) are useful resources to learn more.
