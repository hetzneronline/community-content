## Introduction

This script give the possibility to manage cloud servers using Hetzner API, a graphic terminal and a browser.

**Prerequisites**

The need of a functionnal GUI, ssh and curl installed, a web browser configured and API key-s of server-s to manage.

To obtain a server API key see

* Hetzner Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) in the [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)

## Step 1 - Summary

Edit the script, insert servers IDs with their API key as well as ssh options to access those servers
Also values of variables verbose, mytmp and autoON have to be adapted as well as the prefered method to
run the browser

## Step 2 - Commands

Using this script will allow you to start, restart, stop, see the status, have console access or display metadatas of a cloud server

## Step 3 - Example of commands

hzvs.sh your_host1 on           ; start a server. If it is already up, no action is done and a message will be displayed
hzvs.sh your_host1 off          ; stop server. If it is already down, no action is done and a message will be displayed
hzvs.sh your_host2 reboot       ; restart a server. If it is down, no action is done and a message will be displayed
hzvs.sh your_host2 console run  ; connect to a server console. If server is down it will be started
hzvs.sh your_host2 console      ; connect to a server console. If server is down and autoON=0, a request of start will be displayed, else it will be started

## Conclusion

Easy and effective :)
