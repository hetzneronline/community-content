## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to route cloud servers over private network using pfSense and "Hetzner Cloud Networks".

hcloud-CLI will be used in this tutorial. It can also be done with the Cloud console.

### Why should a server route the traffic over a private network?

The advantage to route the traffic over private networking is that the client servers can be protected by a firewall and are only accessible through the internal IP address. If the public interface of the client servers is disabled, the only access is via the router. It uses NAT (...) to hide the internal network from the public Internet.

## Prerequisites

Following things are required:

- two (2) cloud server (one as pfSense, the other one as client)
- a private network range
- hcloud-CLI
- Cloud console

## Step 1 - Set up the environment

Before anything can be done, the router and the client have to be created. A CX11 as router is enough for the purpose.

To create the servers the following commands have to be executed (the image which will used on the router has no matter):

```
hcloud server create --name router --type cx11 --image ubuntu-18.04
hcloud server create --name private-client --type cx11 --image ubuntu-18.04
```

If this is done, the private network can be created.

```
hcloud network create --name nat-network --ip-range 10.0.0.0/16
```

The network needs also a subnet. This tutorial will use the ip range `10.0.0.0/24` in zone `eu-central`, which includes `hel1`, `fsn1` and `nbg1`.

```
hcloud network add-subnet nat-network --network-zone eu-central --type server --ip-range 10.0.0.0/24
```

The servers needs to get attached to the network. A specification of an IP-address to the router should be done because the traffic will be routed over this server. **The usage of 10.0.0.1 is not possible because this ip is already used to route the packages over multiple hosts.**

```
hcloud server attach-to-network router --network nat-network --ip 10.0.0.2
hcloud server attach-to-network private-client --network nat-network
```

To route the whole traffic to the router in private network, a route is needed. The destination is `0.0.0.0/0` (every ip in every subnet) and the gateway is `10.0.0.2` (the router).

```
hcloud network add-route nat-network --destination 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway 10.0.0.2
```

## Step 2 - Set up the pfSense server

To install pfSense on the router server, mount the image first.

```
hcloud server attach-iso router pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-amd64.iso
```

The ISO name depends on the version. It's possible that the ISO may be is a newer version.

When the ISO is mounted, a reboot/reset of the server is needed and start a web console to perform the installation.

```
hcloud server reset router
```

The web console can be opened in Cloud console.

Perform the installation with the guide.

When the installation is done the ISO can be detached.

```
hcloud server detach-iso router
```

When pfSense is booted, there is a dialog if VLANs should be configured. Type in `n` and press enter.

For the WAN interface use `vtnet0`. Leave LAN interface empty. LAN interface gets set up later.

Confirm the changes with `y`, if WAN is `vtnet0`.

The router is now accessible in browser. Log in with user name `admin` and password `pfsense`.

Follow the installation guide.

On step 4, un-check the option `Block bogon networks`.

Go to `Interfaces -> Assignments` and add the interface `vtnet1`. Now, go to `Interfaces -> LAN` and configure it.

Set the `IPv4 Configuration Type` to `DHCP` and check `Enable interface`.

**Before applying the changes**, go to `System -> Routing -> Static Routes` and create a new route:

```
Destination network: 10.0.0.0/16
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
Description: Make private network reachable for pfSense
```

Apply the changes and go back to `Interfaces -> LAN` and also apply the changes.

Go to `System -> Advanced -> Networking` and enable `Disable hardware checksum offload` under `Network Interfaces` and click `Save`.

Then, go to `Firewall -> NAT -> Outbound` and set the Outbound NAT Mode to `Hybrid Outbound NAT rule generation`.

Create the following mapping rule:

```
Interface: WAN
Address Family: IPv4+IPv6
Protocol: any
Source: 10.0.0.0/16
Destination: any
Translation -> Address: Interface Address
```

Save and **do not apply the changes!**

Go to `Firewall -> Rules -> LAN` and edit the rule with description `Default allow LAN to any rule`.

Change the source from `LAN net` to `any`. Save and apply the changes.

Go to `Firewall -> Rules -> WAN` and create a new rule.

```
Action: Block
Interface: WAN
Address Family: IPv4+IPv6
Protocol: TCP/UDP
Source: any
Destination: this firewall (self)
Destination Port Range: From "HTTP (80)" to "HTTPS (443)"
```

Click `Save` and apply the changes. Now go back to `Firewall -> NAT -> Outbound` and apply the changes.
It may happen that the browser is caching the session.
In this case, close the browser and re-open it. The pfSense UI should not be reachable with the public IP address anymore.

## Step 3 - Set up the client server

On the client check if the private networking interface is attached. It can be done with the following command:

```
ip l
```

It should show an output like this:

```
root@private-client:~# ip l
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: ens10: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

The private network interface has the mtu `1450`. In this case, it is `ens10`.

Edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces`.

#### Disabling the public interface

**This is an optional step!**

If the server should not be reachable with public ip address, the line `source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*.cfg` have to be commented out.

Otherwise `cloud-init` which configures the eth0 interface automatically, saves the network configuration for the public interface in this directory.

After the line is comment out, it should look like this:

```
#source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*.cfg
```

#### Configure route for private networking

Add the following configuration to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
auto ens10
iface ens10 inet dhcp
	post-up ip route add default via 10.0.0.1
```

Private networking by Hetzner Cloud is working on Layer 3 so a default route to the network gateway is needed.

Add the DNS servers by adding the line `dns-nameservers 213.133.100.100 213.133.99.99 213.133.98.98` to `/etc/network/interfaces` under the `post-up` line.

If DNS is still not working `systemd-resolved` ignores this parameter.

In this case, DNS needs to be configured in file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`. There should be a line like `#DNS` under the line `[Resolve]`.
Un-comment the `DNS` line by removing the `#` and type in some DNS servers or use the DNS servers by Hetzner:

```
DNS=213.133.100.100 213.133.99.99 213.133.98.98
```

Save the file and restart the server.

If the public interface is disabled, there is no possibility to access the server with it's external ip anymore.

Login via SSH over the router server or use the HTML5 console.

Try to ping a domain (e.g. `fsn.icmp.hetzner.com`) and if that works, check the tracepath with `mtr` if it's route the traffic over the pfSense server.

The MTR should looks like this (mtr to `fsn.icmp.hetzner.com` on `private-client`):

```
HOST: private-client              Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
