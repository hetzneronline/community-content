# Introduction

Coolify is a modern, open-source deployment and server management platform designed for containerized environments. Powered by Docker, it provides an intuitive web interface for deploying applications, managing infrastructure, and automating DevOps workflows — without complex configurations or vendor lock-in.

This guide walks you through setting up Coolify on a server running **Ubuntu 24.04**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

* A Server running **Ubuntu 24.04**
* **Root** or **sudo** access
* A **registered domain name** pointing to your server’s IP address
* Basic knowledge of **Linux command-line operations**

---

## Step 1 — Update the System

First, update your system packages to ensure compatibility and apply the latest security patches:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2 — Install Coolify

Coolify provides an official installation script that automatically installs dependencies, configures Docker, and sets up the environment.

Run the following command on your server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:

* Install Docker and other required tools
* Download and configure Coolify
* Start the Coolify service automatically

When the installation completes, open your browser and visit:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000
```

to access the Coolify web interface.

---

## Step 3 — Initial Setup and Configuration

1. **Create an account** when prompted on the Coolify interface.
2. Follow the **onboarding process**.
3. When asked where to deploy your server, choose **localhost** (for this guide).
4. Click **Create a New Project** to get started.

Next:

* Go to **Settings → Configuration → General**, and set your domain (e.g. `https://coolify.example-domain.de`).
* Go to **Servers → localhost → General** and set the Wildcard Domain (e.g. `https://example-domain.de`)
* After that click **Start Proxy**.
  By default, Coolify uses **Traefik** as its reverse proxy, but you can switch to another if preferred.
* Try testing whether you can reach the website. If you get a redirect error and use Cloudflare, make sure to activate Full TLS/SSL encryption.

## Step 4 — Configure the Hetzner Firewall

Hetzner Cloud offers a built-in firewall you can manage via the Cloud Console or CLI.
Open your project’s firewall settings and **allow the following ports**:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose       |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| 22   | TCP      | SSH access    |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP traffic  |
| 443  | TCP      | HTTPS traffic |

Once applied, Coolify will only be accessible through your **fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** over HTTPS.

---

## Step 5 — Deploy Your First Application

1. Open your **Project** in Coolify.
2. Click **Add Resource** → choose **Application** or **Database**.
3. To deploy from GitHub:

   * Link your **GitHub account** when prompted.
   * Click **Install Repositories on GitHub**.
   * Grant access to all or specific repositories.
   * Return to Coolify and select the desired repository.
4. Under the **Domain** field, replace the random subdomain with your preferred one.
5. Click **Deploy**.

Once deployment completes, your application will be live under the configured domain.

---

## Final Notes

You have successfully installed and configured **Coolify on (Ubuntu 24.04)**!
Coolify offers far more than basic deployments — including databases, cron jobs, secrets management, and integrations.
