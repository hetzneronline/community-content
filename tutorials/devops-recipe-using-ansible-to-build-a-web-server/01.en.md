## Introduction

This tutorial is for beginner DevOps enthusiasts and it illustrate how to simple setup a Nginx web server, install Docker, 
DockerCompose and configure a Let’s Encrypt certificate managed by Certbot.
The proposed solution is based on Ansible playbooks.

**Prerequisites**

- Create a VPS instance using this [tutorial](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server/)
- Add your public key to your remote VPS. A simple tutorial can be found [here](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/add-ssh-key-to-your-hetzner-cloud)

## Before you start

### Configure Ansible configuration file

Here you can set the inventory file that will be used by Ansible by default when running the playbooks.

``./ansible.cfg``

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
```

### Configure Ansible inventory

Here you can add the IP addresses of the servers that you want to configure.

``./inventory``

```ini
[all]
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.2
127.0.0.3
```

### Configure the environment variables
This project uses some variables that are stored in the ``env.yml`` file that is imported in all playbooks.

``./env.yml``

```yaml
APP_USERNAME: "super_user"
APP_USER_PASSWORD: "strong password"
APP_MAIN_DOMAIN: "domain.com"
LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL: "your_email@mail.com"
NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE: "50M"
TIMEZONE: "Europe/Chisinau"
```

* APP_USERNAME: `super_user` - the username of the user that will be created on the server
* APP_USER_PASSWORD: `strong password` - the password of the user that will be created on the server
* APP_MAIN_DOMAIN: `domain.com` - the main domain that will be used for the server
* LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL: `your_email@mail.com` - the email that will be used for the Let's Encrypt certificate generation
* NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE: `50M` - the maximum body size that Nginx will accept
* TIMEZONE: `Europe/Chisinau` - the timezone that will be set on the server

## Step 1 - Configure the web sever

In this sample the timezone of the server is set to ``TIMEZONE`` variable. This playbook can be extended to set other configurations as well, depending on your needs.

``./playbooks/configure-server.yml``

```yaml
- name: Set the system timezone
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  user: root

  vars_files:
    - ../env.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Set timezone
      ansible.builtin.command:
        cmd: timedatectl set-timezone {{ TIMEZONE }}
```

## Step 2 - Install and configure Nginx

In this step we will install Nginx and configure it to serve the main domain.
Below is the code that will install Nginx and configure it to accept a maximum body size of 50M.

``./playbooks/install-nginx.yml``

```yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  user: root

  vars_files:
    - ../env.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest

    - name: Ensure client_max_body_size is set inside the http block
      ansible.builtin.blockinfile:
        path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        marker: "# {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK"
        block: |
          client_max_body_size {{ NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE }};
        insertafter: '^http\s*{'
        backup: yes

    - name: Reload Nginx to apply changes
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: nginx
        state: reloaded
```


## Step 3 - Install Docker and Docker Compose

The following code will install Docker and Docker compose to your server.

```yaml
- name: Install Docker on Ubuntu
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  become: true
  vars:
    arch_mapping:  # Map ansible architecture {{ ansible_architecture }} names to Docker's architecture names
      x86_64: amd64
      aarch64: arm64

  tasks:
    - name: Update and upgrade all packages to the latest version
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: true
        upgrade: dist
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Install required packages
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        pkg:
          - apt-transport-https
          - ca-certificates
          - curl
          - gnupg
          - software-properties-common

    - name: Create directory for Docker's GPG key
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /etc/apt/keyrings
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Add Docker's official GPG key
      ansible.builtin.apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
        keyring: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        state: present

    - name: Print architecture variables
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Architecture: {{ ansible_architecture }}, Codename: {{ ansible_lsb.codename }}"

    - name: Add Docker repository
      ansible.builtin.apt_repository:
        repo: >-
          deb [arch={{ arch_mapping[ansible_architecture] | default(ansible_architecture) }}
          signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg]
          https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu {{ ansible_lsb.codename }} stable
        filename: docker
        state: present

    - name: Install Docker and related packages
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        update_cache: true
      loop:
        - docker-ce
        - docker-ce-cli
        - containerd.io
        - docker-buildx-plugin
        - docker-compose-plugin

    - name: Add Docker group
      ansible.builtin.group:
        name: docker
        state: present

    - name: Add user to Docker group
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        groups: docker
        append: true

    - name: Enable and start Docker services
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        enabled: true
        state: started
      loop:
        - docker.service
        - containerd.service

```

## Step 4 - Install Certbot and configure Let’s Encrypt certificate

``./playbooks/install-certbot.yml``

The following code will install Certbot and configure a Let's Encrypt certificate for the main domain.

```yaml

- name: Secure the site with Letsencrypt
  hosts: all
  become: true
  user: root

  vars_files:
    - ../env.yml

  vars:
    webroot_path: '/var/www/html'  # the root path of your site
    certbot_source_directory: /usr/local/certbot-src
    certbot_executable_path: "{{ certbot_source_directory }}/venv/bin/certbot"
    email: "{{ LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL }}"
    domain: "{{ APP_MAIN_DOMAIN }}"

  tasks:
    - name: Install required packages for certbot
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name:
          - python3-venv
          - gcc
          - libaugeas0
          - libssl-dev
          - libffi-dev
          - ca-certificates
          - openssl
          - git
          - python3-venv

    - name: Clone the certbot source directory
      ansible.builtin.git:
        depth: 1
        repo: https://github.com/certbot/certbot
        dest: "{{ certbot_source_directory }}"
        update: true

    - name: Create certbot in virtual environment
      ansible.builtin.command: python3 tools/venv.py
      args:
        chdir: "{{ certbot_source_directory }}"

    - name: Generate the SSL certificate
      ansible.builtin.command: "{{ certbot_executable_path }} --nginx -d {{ domain }} --non-interactive --agree-tos --email {{ email }}"

    - name: Set up automatic renewal
      ansible.builtin.cron:
        name: "Certbot automatic renewal"
        job: "{{ certbot_executable_path }} renew --quiet"
        minute: "11"
        hour: "11"

```

Variables used in the playbooks can be found in the `env.yml` file:

- LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL - the email that will be used for the Let's Encrypt certificate generation
- APP_MAIN_DOMAIN - the main domain that will be used for the server and the Let's Encrypt certificate


## Step 5 - Run the playbooks

To run the playbooks, execute the following commands:

```bash
ansible-playbook ./playbooks/configure-server.yml
ansible-playbook ./playbooks/install-nginx.yml
ansible-playbook ./playbooks/install-docker.yml
ansible-playbook ./playbooks/install-certbot.yml
```
After running the playbooks, you should have a web server running Nginx, Docker, Docker Compose and a Let's Encrypt certificate.


## Conclusion

This tutorial is a simple way to setup a web server using Ansible playbooks. The playbooks can be extended to include more configurations and services.
