## Introduction

  

This tutorial covers how to install Prometheus, system monitoring tool on CentOS 8.

  

## What is Prometheus?

  

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.

  

**Prerequisites**

+ A Virtual Machine/Dedicated Server running CentOS 8.
+ Have wget and tar installed.
+ Ports `9090` and `9100` allowed in the firewall (if any configured)
  

## Step 1 - Creating new user

  

To begin with, we'll proceed with adding user to the system and change the default shell of the user so he cannot log in to the system.

  

```bash
useradd -m prometheus
usermod -s /sbin/nologin prometheus
```

  

## Step 2 - Creating directories in which we'll store the Prometheus configuration

  

After we create the user we have to create the locations where the config files will be stored.

  

```bash
mkdir /etc/prometheus
mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
```

  

Once the creation of the folder has been done we have to set the permissions for the Prometheus user on `/var/lib/prometheus`.

  

> `/var/lib` holds state information pertaining to an application or the system.

  

```bash
chown prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

  

### Step 3 - Download latest available Prometheus version

  

To find out which is the latest available version for Prometheus follow -> [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io/download/)
Navigate to the temp folder and download the Prometheus.
```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.20.1/prometheus-2.20.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
  

### Step 4 - Decompress the downloaded archive

Flags that we'll be using:
 - `-z` this option tells **tar** to read or write archives through [**gzip**](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gzip.htm), allowing **tar** to directly operate on several kinds of compressed archives transparently. This option should be used, for example, when operating on files with the extension **.tar.gz**.
 - `-x` tells **tar** to extract files from an archive
 - `-p` when **tar** is extracting an archive, it normally subtracts the user's [umask](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uumask.htm) from the permissions specified in the archive and uses that number as the permissions to create the destination file. Specifying this option instructs tar that it should use the permissions directly from the archive.
 - `-v` operate [verbosely](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/verbose.htm).
 - `-f` use archive file (or device) _ARCHIVE (file name).
 
```bash
tar -zxpvf prometheus-2.20.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.20.1.linux-amd64
```
Now we need to copy the 2 binaries `prometheus` & `promtool` to `/usr/local/bin`.
```bash
cp {prometheus,promtool} /usr/local/bin
```
  

### Step 5 - Configure Prometheus
To configure Prometheus we would have to manually create a config file in `/etc/prometheus` using yaml.
```bash
touch /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
cd /etc/prometheus
nano prometheus.yml
```
This is the default prometheus configuration with which you can only monitor the local machine.
```yaml
# Global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute. 
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute. 
  scrape_timeout: 15s  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).
# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```
### Step 6 - Create Prometheus service (optional)
For more practical way to manage prometheus we can create a systemd service file.
```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```
The configuration:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Time Series Collection and Processing Server
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
> **Don't forget to change the variables in it if you choose to use different user/group or location for the files, if not proceed using the above configuration.**

In order for the changes to be loaded, we would have to reload the `systemctl`
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
# And to start the prometheus service
systemctl start prometheus
```
If you wish for Prometheus to run on a boot:
```bash
systemctl enable prometheus
```
Since we successfully started the Prometheus we can open up our browser and go to [http://your_ip:9090/targets/](http://your_ip:9090/targets/)

### Step 7 - Installation & Configuration of node_exporter (optional)
Prometheus node_exporter is hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

On the same machine as we installed Prometheus we'll proceed with creating a new user.
```bash
useradd -m node_exporter
usermod -s /sbin/nologin node_exporter
```
#### Step 7.1 - Download node_exporter
We first have to navigate to the `/tmp` folder. In order to download the most recent version please follow - [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io/download/)
```bash
cd /tmp
# Download the node exporter
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.0.1/node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Decompress the downloaded archive.
```bash
tar -zxpvf node_exporter-0.18.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Navigate to the extracted directory
cd node_exporter-0.18.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# And copy the binary file - node_exporter in /usr/local/bin
cp node_exporter /usr/local/bin
```

After we copy the files in there we need to give the user `node_exporter` permissions on that file:
```bash
chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```
#### Step 7.2 - Configure node_exporter service
In order for node_exporter to run as service, we need to create a systemd file using the config below.
```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service

# Configuration

[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **Don't forget to change the variables in it if you choose to use different user/group or location for the files, if not proceed using the above configuration.**

In order for the changes to be loaded, we would have to reload the `systemctl`
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
# And to start the node_exporter service
systemctl start node_exporter
```
If you wish for node_exporter to run on a boot:
```bash
systemctl enable node_exporter
```

### Step 8 - Add node_exporter as target to the prometheus config file
To do so, we have to open the config file of the prometheus and add the following:
```bash
nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

```yaml
 - job_name: 'node_exporter'
   static_configs:
   - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```
So the final result of the config file is:
```yaml
# Global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  scrape_timeout: 15s  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).
# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9090']


  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

In order for the changes to be applied we have to restart the Prometheus service:
```bash
systemctl restart prometheus
```
To verify that everything was installed and configured properly, browse to [http://your_ip:9090/targets/](http://your_ip:9090/targets/)

You should see something like this:

And that's pretty much it! ðŸ™‚ 

  

## Conclusion

  

By following this tutorial you will have a fully functional Prometheus server running. The next steps would be to start adding remote systems from which you'll pull the metrics! ðŸ™‚
