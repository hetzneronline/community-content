## Introduction

Rocket.Chat is an open-source communication platform which allows users to chat with each other without sending the messages to external companies.

This tutorial shows how to install and configure a basic Rocket.Chat instance on Ubuntu 24.04 using [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs). There are also other possibilities to install Rocket.Chat. For that the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat) should be consulted.

**Prerequisites**

* Ubuntu 24.04 server with root privileges
* Domain for accessing the instance (in this tutorial `chat.example.com` is used)

## Step 1 - Configuring a firewall

First, a basic firewall should be set up so that only the desired ports are accessible from the Internet. In this case we're configuring the firewall using [UFW](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW). The firewall will be configured to allow traffic via port `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS) and `22` (SSH - should be changed if you use an other port!).

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 2 - Installing Rocket.Chat

Before we can start installing Rocket.Chat, we need to install snapd:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

Afterwards we can install Rocket.Chat using snap:

```bash
sudo snap install rocketchat-server
```

**ATTENTION** If you don't use a firewall, the Rocket.Chat instance is now exposed publicly over port `3000`.

## Step 3 - Configuring SSL

The Rocket.Chat snap container already ships a reverse proxy (Caddy) which can obtain a SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt. It only needs to be configured with the domain for the chat system:

```bash
sudo snap set rocketchat-server caddy=enable
sudo snap set rocketchat-server https=enable
sudo snap set rocketchat-server siteurl=https://<chat.example.com>

```

If no errors occurred, the Rocket.Chat and Caddy container can be restarted:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-server.service
sudo systemctl restart snap.rocketchat-server.rocketchat-caddy.service
```

Now the Rocket.Chat instance is reachable through the configured domain and HTTP is redirected to HTTPS.

## Step 4 - Configuring Rocket.Chat

Open the web browser and navigate to the domain we have set up above. Now Rocket.Chat should automatically open the setup wizard, where it asks for the credentials for the first user which automatically gets admin permissions.

Afterwards the setup wizard will ask for some organization info. Enter these details and then click on `Continue`.

In the last step, you are asked for an email address to register the server in the Rocket.Chat Cloud. This is something you need to decide depending on your guidelines.

Afterwards, check your emails to verify the registration.

## Step 5 - Exploring Rocket.Chat

Finally you can start using Rocket.Chat!

**ATTENTION** The registration form is enabled by default! This and much more can be changed in the admin area of your Rocket.Chat instance.

## Conclusion

You now have a working basic Rocket.Chat installation. You can now start customizing your instance or just start chatting with your friends or colleagues.
