## Introduction

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is a popular Ruby-based web framework for building fullstack applications. Rails (as it's popularly known) is well known for it's model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, ability to scaffold features, and large user community. In this tutorial, we shall learn how to build a simple Ruby on Rails 8 web application and deploy it to a Hetzner virtual private server using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/), a nifty, zero-downtime deploy tool for deploying applications to the cloud using Docker containers.

**Prerequisites**

* A server running Ubuntu version 22.04 or later
  * [SSH access](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) to that server
  * Access to the root user or a user with sudo permissions
* Basic knowledge of [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#introduction) and [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/)
* Local development set up with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

**Example terminology**

Many tutorials will need to include example usernames, hostnames, domains, and IPs. To simplify this, all tutorials should use the same default examples, as outlined below.

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

Do **not** use actual IPs in your tutorial.

## Step 1 - Summary of Step

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.

Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial.

It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.

Feel free to include screenshots, to show exactly what the user should be seeing. Please put screenshots in a separate "images" folder.

The amount of steps will depend entirely on how long/complicated the tutorial is.

## Step 2 - Summary of Step

Quick introduction.

Start by...

Then...

Finally...

### Step 2.1 - Summary of Step

You can create code examples in nearly every programming language.
Just state the language after the first three backticks in your Markdown file.

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - Summary of Step

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - Summary of Step (Optional)

Instructions for a step that is not necessary to complete the tutorial, but can be helpful.

## Step N - Summary of Step

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
