## Introduction

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is a popular Ruby-based web framework for building fullstack applications. Rails (as it's popularly known) is well known for it's model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, ability to scaffold features, and large user community.

In this tutorial, we shall learn how to build a simple Ruby on Rails 8 web application and deploy it to a virtual private server using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/), a nifty, zero-downtime deploy tool for deploying applications to the cloud using Docker containers.

On the local device, we will use the following files:
```shell
my_blog_app
├──  config/deploy.yml        Kamal deploy configuration file
└── .kamal/secrets            Secret credentials used in config/deploy.yml
```

When you deploy `config/deploy.yml`, Kamal will connect to the virtual private server, install Docker, and start a container with the image that we will create on the local device beforehand.

**Prerequisites**

* A local device
  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) are already installed
    <br>Make sure your user is added to the Docker group
  * An SSH key pair (public key has to be on the server)

<br>

* A server running Ubuntu version 22.04 (or later), or Debian 11 (or later)
  * [SSH access](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) to that server
  * Access to the root user

<br>

* Basic knowledge of [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#introduction) and [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/)

## Step 1 - Initiate a new Ruby on Rails app

On the local device, initialize a new Ruby on Rails application with the following command:

```shell
rails new my_blog_app
```

This command will setup a new Rails application with an SQLite database and some default boilerplate code which includes a Dockerfile and the Kamal configuration which we'll work with later on.

Next, `cd` into the app directory and run the command below to spin up a server to run the app:

* **On private interface**
  ```shell
  rails server -d
  ```
  Then visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the default home page.

<br>

* **On public interface**
  ```shell
  rails server -d -b 0.0.0.0
  ```
  Then visit `http://<public_ip_of_local_device>:3000` to view the default home page.

Now we are ready to create the blog functionality.

## Step 2 - Building the blog posting feature

We'll use one of Rails' notable features to build this functionality — scaffolding.

Start by running the command below:

```shell
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text
```

This command generates a bunch of files including:

* A migration file to create the database table for posts.

* A model that will give us an intuitive way to interact with this table and the database.

* A controller to hold all post-related business logic.

* Adding routes for handling post creation, editing, updating and deleting to the app's route configuration.

* Post views for handling _create_, _read_, _edit_ and _delete_ actions.

Then, run the newly generated database migration file using the command below to create the posts table in the database:

```shell
rails db:migrate
rails db:migrate:status
```

Finally, add `/posts` at the and of the URL and play around with the app by creating a few posts:

```
http://localhost:3000/posts
```

![create-new-post](images/create-new-post.png)

## Step 3 - Create a server that will host the blog

If you haven't already, create a server (e.g. with Hetzner on [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud)). Select `Ubuntu 24.04` as the operating system and add your SSH key.

You can read the [documentation here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for steps on how to generate an SSH key.

It is important that your local device can access the root user of the server via an SSH key, as Kamal relies on this to connect to the server.

## Step 4 - Prepare the server for the Kamal deployment (Optional)

* Go to the server list in Cloud Console and copy your server's IP address (e.g. 203.0.113.1)
* Connect to your server:
  ```bash
  ssh root@203.0.113.1
  ```
* Update your server:
  ```bash
  apt update && apt upgrade -y
  ```
* Double-check if the public key of your local device is on the server
  ```bash
  cat  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```
* Reboot the server:
  ```bash
  reboot
  ```

_Note: We could manually install Docker on the server, but since Kamal can handle this for us, there's no need to go through the manual process._

## Step 5 - Make your app ready for the Kamal deployment

Follow this step on your local device.

Since we are working with a simple Ruby on Rails application, our main job will be on the Kamal deploy configuration file `config/deploy.yml`.

Start by opening up the file and editing it to resemble the example with a registry shown below:

> *Replace the following variables with your information:*
> * `<name_of_your_app>`
> * `<username/repository_name>`
> * `<your_app_domain_name>`
> * `<docker_registry>`
> * `<your_docker_username>`
> 
> Also change `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` to `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

```yaml
# Name of your application. Used to uniquely configure containers.
service: <name_of_your_app>

# Name of the container image.
image: <username/repository_name>

# Deploy to these servers.
servers:
  web:
    - 203.0.113.1

# Enable SSL auto certification via Let's Encrypt
proxy:
  ssl: true
  host: <your_app_domain_name>

# Credentials for your image host.
registry:
  # Specify the registry server, if you're not using Docker Hub
  server: <docker_registry>
  username: <your_docker_username>

  # Always use an access token rather than real password when possible.
  password:
    - DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Inject ENV variables into containers (secrets come from .kamal/secrets).
env:
  secret:
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
    - DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
  clear:
    SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA: true

aliases:
  console: app exec --interactive --reuse "bin/rails console"
  shell: app exec --interactive --reuse "bash"
  logs: app logs -f
  dbc: app exec --interactive --reuse "bin/rails dbconsole"

volumes:
  - "my_blog_app_storage:/rails/storage"

asset_path: /rails/public/assets

# Configure the image builder.
builder:
  arch: amd64
```

Kamal will connect to the root user of the server (in this example `203.0.113.1`). For this to work, the public SSH key of your local device needs to be in the `authorized_keys` on your server.

You can get more details on configuring the Kamal deploy configuration file from the [documentation](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/overview/).

### Step 5.1 - Setup Kamal secrets

It's never a good idea to commit secrets like the repository tokens, database passwords and other sensitive data to your Git repository, so we make use of the secrets file `.kamal/secrets`.

First, ensure this file is never committed to your Git repository by adding it to the `.gitignore` file:

```ignore
[...]

/.kamal/secrets
```

Now edit `.kamal/secrets` and add the following variable:

```
DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<your_access-token_or_password>
```

Finally, with the deploy configuration done, commit your changes to Git.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git add .
git commit -a -m "Initial commit"
git log
```

## Step 6 - Deploy the app

Deploy the Rails 8 app with the command below:

```shell
kamal setup
```

But just in case you get an error like the one shown below:

```shell
ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c bundle install &&     rm -rf ~/.bundle/ \"${BUNDLE_PATH}\"/ruby/*/cache \"${BUNDLE_PATH}\"/ruby/*/bundler/gems/*/.git &&     bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile" did not complete successfully
```

Edit the `Dockerfile` and add an additional step that installs the `libyaml-dev` package like so:

```Dockerfile
...

# Install application gems
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libyaml-dev
RUN bundle install && \
    rm -rf ~/.bundle/ "${BUNDLE_PATH}"/ruby/*/cache "${BUNDLE_PATH}"/ruby/*/bundler/gems/*/.git && \
    bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
...
```

Then commit the changes and retry the Kamal setup once more:

```shell
git add . && git commit -a -m "Update Dockerfile"
kamal setup
```

In a nutshell, the `kamal setup` command will:

* Log into your server
* Install any server prerequisites, for example, Linux packages, database packages etc.
* Fetch and install Docker if it is not installed
* Fetch your app from the Git repository and push it to the image registry you specified
* Fetch your app's image from the image registry and deploy it to the server
* Create and assign an SSL certificate for the domain name you specified
* Make your app availalbe on the domain you specified

Once everything is setup, you should be able to access the web application on your server. Remember to add `/posts` at the end of the URL again:

```
https://example.com/posts
```
