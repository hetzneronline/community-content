## Introduction

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) is a popular Ruby-based web framework for building fullstack applications. Rails (as it's popularly known) is well known for it's model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, ability to scaffold features, and large user community. In this tutorial, we shall learn how to build a simple Ruby on Rails 8 web application and deploy it to a Hetzner virtual private server using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/), a nifty, zero-downtime deploy tool for deploying applications to the cloud using Docker containers.

**Prerequisites**

* A server running Ubuntu version 22.04 or later
  * [SSH access](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key) to that server
  * Access to the root user or a user with sudo permissions
* Basic knowledge of [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#introduction) and [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/)
* Local development set up with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Step 1 - Build Rails App

Initialize a new Ruby on Rails application with the following command:

```shell
rails new my_blog_app
```

This command will setup a Rails application with an SQLite database.

Next, `cd` into the app directory and run the command below to spin up a server to run the app:

```shell
rails server
```

Then visit, <http://localhost:3000> to view the default home page.

Now we are ready to create the blog functionality.

## Step 2 - Building the Blog Posting Feature

We'll use one of Rails' notable features to build this functionality, scaffolding.

Start by running the command below:

```shell
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text
```

This command generates a bunch of files including:

* A migration file to create the database table for posts.

* A model that will give us an intuitive way to interact with this table and the database.

* A controller to hold all post-related business logic.

* Adding routes for handling post creation, editing, updating and deleting to the app's route configuration.

* Post views for handling _create_, _read_, _edit_ and _delete_ actions.

Finally, run newly generated database migration file using the command below to create the posts table in the database:

```shell
rails db:migrate
```

### Step 2.1 - Summary of Step

You can create code examples in nearly every programming language.
Just state the language after the first three backticks in your Markdown file.

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - Summary of Step

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - Summary of Step (Optional)

Instructions for a step that is not necessary to complete the tutorial, but can be helpful.

## Step N - Summary of Step

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
