## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to provision vServer machines at Hetzner Cloud with the latest version of [Fedora CoreOS](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/), using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

**Prerequisites**

* Basic knowledge about the Hetzner Cloud
* Hetzner Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) generated at [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
* [`terraform` CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed

**Example terminology**

* IP addresses: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`

## Step 1 - Install Terraform Hetzner Cloud Provider

Create a new folder as the working directory for the next steps, e.g. `terraform-coreos`, and create a `versions.tf` file with the following content:

```tf
# versions.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    hcloud = {
      source = "hetznercloud/hcloud"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}
```

Now execute `terraform init` to install the [Terraform Hetzner Cloud Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hetznercloud/hcloud/latest/docs).

## Step 2 - Build `coreos-installer` 🔨

Currently, the [`coreos-installer`](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer) is not available as a binary. Therefore, you need to install rust's package manager [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Once the installation is complete, remember to configure your current shell as suggested below `Rust is installed now. Great!` and make sure you can use rustc and cargo (`rustc --version && cargo --version`).

Build the binary on a Linux machine:

```bash
cargo install --target-dir . coreos-installer
```

If you get an error, you might be missing some prerequisites (e.g. `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `libzstd-dev`). After it is built, look for the coreos-installer binary. If the `coreos-installer` command is already working, you can use `ls -l $(which coreos-installer)` to find the location of the binary.

Later, Terraform will copy the binary to the vServer in rescue mode, so you have to move it as `coreos-installer` into your working directory. Building the binary in rescue mode on the vServer will fail, if there is not enough space on the initramfs (like on cx11).

## Step 3 - Terraform configuration 🤓

### Step 3.1 - Required configuration files

To instruct Terraform how to setup and configure your servers, create a `main.tf` file:

```tf
# main.tf

####
# Variables
##

variable "hcloud_token" {
  description = "Hetzner Cloud API Token"
  type = string
}

variable "ssh_public_key_file" {
  description = "Local path to your public key"
  type = string
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}

variable "ssh_private_key_file" {
  description = "Local path to your private key"
  type = string
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}

variable "ssh_public_key_name" {
  description = "Name of your public key to identify at Hetzner Cloud portal"
  type = string
  default = "My-SSH-Key"
}

variable "hcloud_server_type" {
  description = "vServer type name, lookup via `hcloud server-type list`"
  type = string
  default = "cx21"
}

variable "hcloud_server_datacenter" {
  description = "Desired datacenter location name, lookup via `hcloud datacenter list`"
  type = string
  default = "fsn1-dc14"
}

variable "hcloud_server_name" {
  description = "Name of the server"
  type = string
  default = "www1"
}

# Update version to the latest release of Butane
variable "tools_butane_version" {
  description = "See https://github.com/coreos/butane/releases for available versions"
  type = string
  default = "0.19.0"
}



####
# Infrastructure config
##

provider "hcloud" {
  token = var.hcloud_token
}

resource "hcloud_ssh_key" "key" {
  name = var.ssh_public_key_name
  public_key = file(var.ssh_public_key_file)
}

resource "hcloud_server" "master" {
  name = var.hcloud_server_name
  labels = { "os" = "coreos" }

  server_type = var.hcloud_server_type
  datacenter = var.hcloud_server_datacenter

  # Image is ignored, as we boot into rescue mode, but is a required field
  image = "fedora-39"
  rescue = "linux64"
  ssh_keys = [hcloud_ssh_key.key.id]

  connection {
    host = self.ipv4_address
    timeout = "5m"
    private_key = file(var.ssh_private_key_file)
    # Root is the available user in rescue mode
    user = "root"
  }

  # Wait for the server to be available
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "until nc -zv ${self.ipv4_address} 22; do sleep 5; done"
  }

  # Copy config.yaml and replace $ssh_public_key variable
  provisioner "file" {
    content = replace(file("config.yaml"), "$ssh_public_key", trimspace(file(var.ssh_public_key_file)))
    destination = "/root/config.yaml"
  }

  # Copy coreos-installer binary, as initramfs has not sufficient space to compile it in rescue mode
  provisioner "file" {
    source = "coreos-installer"
    destination = "/usr/local/bin/coreos-installer"
  }

  # Install Butane in rescue mode
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "set -x",
      # Convert ignition yaml into json using Butane
      "wget -O /usr/local/bin/butane 'https://github.com/coreos/butane/releases/download/v${var.tools_butane_version}/butane-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'",
      "chmod +x /usr/local/bin/butane",
      "butane --strict < config.yaml > config.ign",
      # coreos-installer binary is copied, if you have sufficient RAM available, you can also uncomment the following
      # two lines and comment-out the `chmod +x` line, to build coreos-installer in rescue mode
      # "apt install cargo",
      # "cargo install coreos-installer",
      "chmod +x /usr/local/bin/coreos-installer",
      # Download and install Fedora CoreOS to /dev/sda
      "coreos-installer install /dev/sda -i /root/config.ign",
      # Exit rescue mode and boot into coreos
      "reboot"
    ]
  }

  # Wait for the server to be available
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "until nc -zv ${self.ipv4_address} 22; do sleep 15; done"
  }

  # Configure CoreOS after installation
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      host = self.ipv4_address
      timeout = "1m"
      private_key = file(var.ssh_private_key_file)
      # This user is configured in config.yaml
      user = "core"
    }

    inline = [
      "sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ${self.name}"
      # Add additional commands if needed
    ]
  }
}
```

Additionally we need a [Fedore CoreOS Configuration file](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/producing-ign/) named `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# For docs, see: https://coreos.github.io/butane/specs/

variant: fcos
version: 1.5.0

passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      groups:
        - docker
        - wheel
        - sudo
      ssh_authorized_keys:
        # Will be replaced by terraform script
        - $ssh_public_key
      # If you need ssh password login, generate hash via `openssl passwd -1` and insert it below
      # password_hash: $1$1234567890abcdef...

# If you need ssh password login, uncomment the following lines
#
# storage:
#   files:
#     - path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/20-enable-passwords.conf
#       mode: 0644
#       contents:
#         inline: |
#           # Fedora CoreOS disables SSH password login by default.
#           # Enable it.
#           # This file must sort before 40-disable-passwords.conf.
#           PasswordAuthentication yes
```

### Step 3.2 - Adjust the configuration files

In the section `Variables` of the `main.tf`, adjust the default values for `ssh_public_key`, `ssh_public_key_name`, `hcloud_server_type`, `hcloud_server_datacenter` and `hcloud_server_name` to your needs or add a [`terraform.tfvars` file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) to set your desired settings.

Optionally, have a look at the `config.yaml`. This file will be used by the `coreos-installer` to configure the OS. For the first try, you should leave it as it is. But after successful provisioning, you want to add `systemd` service definitions to [run containers](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/running-containers/) on it.

## Step 4 - Get it up and running! 🚀

Run `terraform apply`, enter your Hetzner Cloud API Token if prompted, and let the magic be done!

After a successful installation, you will see the message `Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`.

`terraform show` now outputs you all information about your new machine:

```tf
# hcloud_server.master:
resource "hcloud_server" "master" {
    backups      = false
    datacenter   = "fsn1-dc14"
    id           = "1234567"
    image        = "fedora-39"
    ipv4_address = "<203.0.113.1>"
    ipv6_address = "<2001:db8:5678::1>"
    ipv6_network = "<2001:db8:5678::/64>"
    keep_disk    = false
    labels       = {
        "os" = "coreos"
    }
    location     = "fsn1"
    name         = "www1"
    rescue       = "linux64"
    server_type  = "cx21"
    ssh_keys     = [
        "1234567",
    ]
    status       = "running"
}
```

As defined in the `config.yaml`, a new user `core` has been added, so you can ssh via `ssh core@<203.0.113.1>` to your fresh Fedora CoreOS machine!

## Step 5 - Do it again 🔂

You can now incrementally fill the two configuration files, to setup your services/containers. Run `terraform destroy`, confirm with `yes` and now adjust the files and recreate the infrastructure via `terraform apply`. But keep a look at the Hetzner Cloud Portal to ensure that there haven't been spawned any "ghost machines" 👻

## Conclusion

You have now a fully working Fedora CoreOS machine at Hetzner Cloud, set up with Terraform. 🎉
