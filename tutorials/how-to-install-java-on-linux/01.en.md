## Introduction

Java is a widely used programming language and runtime environment. 
It is used for developing a wide variety of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise systems. 
If you are a developer, you may need to install a specific version of Java on your Linux system. 
In this article, we will discuss the steps to install Java 8, Java 11, Java 15, and Java 17 on Linux systems.

## Step 1: Update Your System

Before installing any version of Java, it is recommended to update your system to the latest version. Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

This command will update your system and install any available updates.

## Step 2: Install OpenJDK

Most Linux distributions include the OpenJDK package, which can be used to install different versions of Java. To install OpenJDK, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

This command will install the default version of OpenJDK on your system.

## Step 3: Install Java

To install Java 8, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

This command will install Java 8 on your system.

If you want to install Java 11, then run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```

This command will install Java 11 on your system.

Need Java 15? Everything is quite simple here! Just run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-15-jdk
```

This command will install Java 15 on your system.

To install Java 17, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
```

This command will install Java 17 on your system.

Using these simple commands, you can install all necessary versions of Java on your Linux server.

## Step 4: Verify Installation

To verify that a particular version of Java is installed correctly, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

This command will display the version of Java that is currently being used. If the version displayed is the one you just installed, then the installation was successful.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed the steps required to install different versions of Java on Linux systems. 
By following these simple steps, you can easily install Java 8, Java 11, Java 15, and Java 17 and start developing Java applications on your Linux system.
