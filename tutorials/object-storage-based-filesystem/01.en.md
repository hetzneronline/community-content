## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to mount an S3 bucket onto the local filesystem of a server using [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse).

> **Recommendation**: This guide uses Hetzner Object Storage, which offers S3-compatible storage with excellent price-performance ratio and European data centers. More information: [Hetzner Object Storage Documentation](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/overview/)

## Step 1 - Installation

* For Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install s3fs
  ```

* For CentOS/RHEL:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install s3fs-fuse
  ```

* From source (if needed):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install automake autotools-dev g++ git libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfuse-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pkg-config
  git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git
  cd s3fs-fuse
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

## Step 2 - Configure Access Credentials and mount point
> For Hetzner Object Storage, create access credentials in the Hetzner Cloud Console

1. Create a credentials file:
   ```bash
   echo "ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" | sudo tee /root/.passwd-s3fs > /dev/null
   ```

2. Set proper permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 600 /root/.passwd-s3fs
   ```

3. Create the mount point
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/s3storage
   ```

## Step 3 - Mounting Options

In the mount commands, replace `<bucket_name>` and `https://nbg1.your-objectstorage.com/` with your actual bucket name and endpoint.

If you use Hetzner Object Storage, the URL must be chosen according to the region where your Bucket was created. You can find your region in the Hetzner Cloud Console under "Object Storage". You can find a list of available regions and endpoints in their [Object Storage overview](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/overview#available-endpoints). Example: If your Bucket was created in Nuremberg, use the URL `https://nbg1.your-objectstorage.com` in your mount commands and fstab. You cannot change the region after the Bucket was created.

Note: An incorrect endpoint URL will result in connection errors.

* Manual Mount Command
  ```bash
  sudo s3fs <bucket_name> /mnt/s3storage \
       -o url=https://nbg1.your-objectstorage.com/ \
       -o allow_other \
       -o use_path_request_style \
       -o use_cache=/tmp/s3fs \
       -o multipart_size=100 \
       -o parallel_count=8 \
       -o big_writes \
       -o kernel_cache \
       -o umask=0022 \
       -o enable_noobj_cache \
       -o retries=5 \
       -o ensure_diskfree=20000 \
       -o connect_timeout=180 \
       -o max_dirty_data=1024 \
       -o max_stat_cache_size=100000 \
       -o passwd_file=/root/.passwd-s3fs
  ```

* Automatic Mount via fstab
  
  Add this line to `/etc/fstab`:
  ```bash
  s3fs#<bucket_name> /mnt/s3storage fuse _netdev,allow_other,use_path_request_style,url=https://nbg1.your-objectstorage.com/,use_cache=/tmp/s3fs,multipart_size=100,parallel_count=8,big_writes,kernel_cache,umask=0022,enable_noobj_cache,retries=5,ensure_diskfree=20000,connect_timeout=180,max_dirty_data=1024,max_stat_cache_size=100000,passwd_file=/root/.passwd-s3fs 0 0
  ```

Configuration Parameters Explained:

Network Settings

| Flag        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <kbd>url=</kbd> | Object storage endpoint URL |
| <kbd>connect_timeout=180</kbd> | Connection timeout in seconds |
| <kbd>retries=5</kbd> | Number of retry attempts |
| <kbd>use_path_request_style</kbd> | Uses path-style S3 URLs |

Cache Configuration

| Flag        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <kbd>use_cache=/tmp/s3fs</kbd> | Local cache directory |
| <kbd>max_stat_cache_size=100000</kbd> | Maximum stat cache entries |
| <kbd>enable_noobj_cache</kbd> | Caches non-existent objects |
| <kbd>max_dirty_data=1024</kbd> | Maximum dirty cache data (MB) |

Performance Options
  
| Flag        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <kbd>multipart_size=100</kbd> | Multipart upload size (MB) |
| <kbd>parallel_count=8</kbd> | Parallel connection count |
| <kbd>big_writes</kbd> | Enables larger write operations |
| <kbd>kernel_cache</kbd> | Enables kernel caching |
| <kbd>ensure_diskfree=20000</kbd> | Minimum free space (MB) |

Permission Settings

| Flag        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <kbd>allow_other</kbd> | Allows access by other users |
| <kbd>umask=0022</kbd> | Standard Unix permissions |

## Step 4 - Testing and Verification

* Test Mount Command
  ```bash
  # Manual mount
  sudo s3fs your-bucket /mnt/s3storage [options as above]
  
  # Verify mount
  df -h
  mount | grep s3fs
  ```

* Test fstab Entry
  ```bash
  # Test fstab entry without reboot
  sudo mount -a
  
  # Verify mount
  df -h
  mount | grep s3fs
  ```

## Step 5 - Troubleshooting

* Debug Mode
  ```bash
  # Add these options for debugging
  -o dbglevel=info -f -o curldbg
  ```

* Common Issues
  
  Permission Problems:
  ```bash
  # Check file permissions
  sudo ls -la /root/.passwd-s3fs
  ls -la /mnt/s3storage
  ```
  
  Cache Issues:
  ```bash
  # Clear cache
  sudo rm -rf /tmp/s3fs/*
  ```

## Step 6 - Maintenance

* Unmounting
  ```bash
  # Manual unmount
  sudo umount /mnt/s3storage
  
  # Force unmount if needed
  sudo umount -f /mnt/s3storage
  ```

* Cache Management
  ```bash
  # Clear cache
  sudo rm -rf /tmp/s3fs/*
  
  # Create new cache directory
  sudo mkdir -p /tmp/s3fs
  sudo chmod 777 /tmp/s3fs
  ```

## Step 7 - Security Best Practices

1. Always use HTTPS endpoints
2. Secure credentials file:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 600 /root/.passwd-s3fs
   ```
3. Regular permission audits
4. Monitor access logs
5. Implement backup strategy

## Step 8 - Performance Optimization for Object Storage

For optimal performance with object storage:

- Choose the closest endpoint to your server
- Use appropriate `multipart_size` (100MB is good for most cases)
- Adjust `parallel_count` based on your bandwidth (8-16 is recommended)
- Enable `kernel_cache` for better read performance
- Use `big_writes` for improved write performance
- Consider using a server that is in the same region as your object storage

Remember to test thoroughly after any configuration changes.

## Conclusion

In `/mnt/s3storage`, you should see the contents of you S3 bucket. Via this path, you can now add or remove data in your bucket just as you would in any other directory on the server.
