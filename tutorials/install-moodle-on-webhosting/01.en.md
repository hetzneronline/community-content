# What is Moodle?
Moodle is a free online learning platform where you can create courses for students and they can graduate them.

**Example terminology**
* Username: `moodlec`
* Hostname: `<wwwXXX>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<moodle.example.com>`

# Install Moodle

## Step 1 - Download moodle

To download [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) you either need a SSH- or FTP connection to the server. The login details can be found in the  [konsoleH](https://konsoleh.hetzner.com/) under `Access details`â†’`Login data`.
![](./images/01_konsoleH_login-data.png)

* **Option 1 - Via an SSH connection**<br>
  For this option, you need [Web Hosting L](https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting) or higher.

  * **1.1** <u>Download the file</u><br>
    After you establish an SSH connection to your server, you can download the file directly into the `public_html` directory.
    ```bash
    moodlc@<wwwXXX>:~$ wget https://packaging.moodle.org/stable500/moodle-latest-500.tgz
    ```
  
  * **1.2** <u>Unzip the file</u><br>
    Once the `tar.gz` file is downloaded, you can unzip it.
    ```bash
    moodlc@<wwwXXX>:~$ tar -xf moodle-latest-500.tgz
    ```
    The current directory should now include the `moodle` directory.

  * **1.3** <u>Move the files</u><br>
    You can now move the directory into to the `public_html` directory.
    ```bash
    moodlc@<wwwXXX>:~$ mv moodle ~/public_html
    ```
    The `public_html` directory should now include the `moodle` directory.

* **Option 2 - Via an FTP connection**<br>
  
  * **1.1** <u>Download the file on your local device</u><br>
    Open https://download.moodle.org/download.php/stable500/moodle-latest-500.zip to download the latest version.
  
  * **1.2** <u>Unzip the file</u><br>
    * On your local device, open the "Downloads" directory. There, you should see the Moodle ZIP file.
    * Right-click on the Drupal file.
    * In the menu that opens, select "Extract Here" (Linux) or "Extract All" (Windows).
  
  * **1.3** <u>Upload the unzipped files via FTP</u><br>
    You now need to copy the files on the server via FTP. The `moodle` directory should be in the "Downloads" directory. Select the directory on your local device and copy it to the `public_html` directory on the server.


## Step 2 - Changing the webroot

* Open [konsoleH](https://konsoleh.hetzner.com/)
* Go to `Settings` > `Server Configuration`
* Select the directory `moodle` beneath `public_html`.
* Click on "Change document root"

## Step 3 - Edit the PHP settings

* Stay in konsoleH.
* Go to `Settings` > `PHP Configuration`
* Scroll down to "PHP settings" and set the value of  `may_input_vars` to 5000
* Scroll to the bottom and save the changes

## Step 4 - Creating a database

* Stay in konsoleH.
* Select Services > MariaDB/MySQL
* Create a new Database (add)
* Confirm database creation (add)
* Keep the browser-tab open to enter the login credentials later.

## Step 5 - Installing Moodle

Open your website in the browser (i.e. `moodle.example.com`). There you should see the installation prompt for Moodle.

* Select a Language and click on `next`.
  ![](./images/04_Moodle_installation-language.png)
* set the Data directory to `/usr/home/moodlc/moodle` (replace with your username).
  ![](./images/05_Moodle_directories.png)
* Select MariaDB as database type.
  ![](./images/06_Moodle_database-type.png)
* Inset your database login details from konsoleH.
  ![](./images/07_Moodle_database-login.png)
* Confirm the license, server-check and installation (at the bottom respectively).
* Afterwards, enter your information for the new Moodle admin user.

* Then you can enter the name and description of your website.
* Finishing up, you can choose to register the site or skip this step at the bottom left.
