## Introduction

In this article i will teach you how to host your own SMTP relay server. Maybe you are like me and want to self-host your own email server but sadly your ISP blocks outgoing SMTP server (port 25) and really all you have left is either give up or use 3rd party service for outgoing SMTP server. So today i will show you how to be your own outgoing SMTP server :)

Before we start i will assume you already have a mail client (something like mailcow) and already added needed DNS records in order for our email to work (MX dns records and other needed ones)

**Prerequisites**

* Debian 11 Server with SMTP port unblocked
* Domain name
* Root access (we will install some stuff)

## Step 0 - `Initial setup`

1. Make sure our system is up-to-date
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgade
```

2. Copy our VPS's IP and go to our domain settings and make an A record DNS entery for our SMTP server, something like
```text
A smtp.example.com 10.0.0.1 3h
```
*A*: is our DNS type

*smtp.example.com*: our SMTP domain (we need it later) it's something like *smtp.gmail.com*

*10.0.0.1*: our VPS's IP

*3h*: time-to-live for our DNS record

## Step 1 - `Check if we have SMTP port opened or not`

So to check if we have SMTP port open or not, we simply need to install `telnet` package by running:
```bash
apt install telnet
```
then run this commandline:
```bash
telnet smtp.gmail.com 25
```
(this commandline will make a connection with gmail's SMTP server, if it connected that means we have SMTP port opened)

## Step 2 - `Install Postfix and config it`

1. Install mailutils and postfix
```bash
apt install mailutils postfix
```
Hit `ok`

then Select `Internet Site` 

in **mail name** add your main domain name, something like ***exmaple.org***

2. open */etc/postfix/main.cf* and change **mydestination** from:
```cf
mydestination = $myhostname, example.com, localhost.com, , localhost
```
to:
```cf
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain
```

and add this line
```cf
mydomain = exmaple.com
```
change *example.com* to your main domain not sub domain (*ex: exmaple.com*)

and then make sure these lines exist in our `main.cf` file:
```cf
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtpd_sasl_path = smtpd
```

3. Make sure postfix is running in chroot

Open */etc/postfix/master.cf* and make sure to change **smtp** line from:
```cf
smtp inet n - n - - smtpd
```
to:
```cf
smtp inet n - - - - smtpd
```

4. Change port of SMTP. If you are like me, probably your ISP is blocking outgoing SMTP port (we can't connect to sites via 25 port) so we need to change our SMTP port in postfix so we can connect to it by a diffrent port number.

Open */etc/postfix/master.cf* and copy **smtp** line:
```cf
smtp inet n - - - - smtpd
```
and change it to: 
```cf
587 inet n - - - - smtpd
```
*587* is our port number and we can change it to whatever we want.

5. Restart postfix
```bash
systemctl restart postfix
```

6. Test if we can send email or not
```bash
echo "This is the body of our email" | mail -s "This is the subject" your_email_address
```
*your_email_address* is your email address, something like tim@example.org

### Step 3 - `Setup SASL`

1. Install `libsasl2-modules`, `postfix` and `sasl2-bin`
```bash
apt install libsasl2-modules postfix sasl2-bin
```
2. Create a file: `/etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf`
```bash
nano /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
```
and paste:
```conf
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5 NTLM
```
3. Setup a separate saslauthd process to be used from Postfix

3.1. Create a copy of saslauthd's config file
```bash
cp /etc/default/saslauthd /etc/default/saslauthd-postfix
```

3.2. and edit it to:
```conf
START=yes
DESC="SASL Auth. Daemon for Postfix"
NAME="saslauthd-postf"      # max. 15 char.
MECHANISMS="sasldb"
# Option -m sets working dir for saslauthd (contains socket)
OPTIONS="-c -m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"        # postfix/smtp in chroot()
```
3.3. remove the old saslauthd
```bash
rm -rf /run/saslauthd
```
3.4. make a softlink of our new saslauthd (that we created for postfix)
```bash
ln -s /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd   /run/saslauthd
```
When we restart our server this link will get deleted so make sure we create it again by running same code

4. Create required subdirectories in postfix chroot directory:
```bash
dpkg-statoverride --add root sasl 710 /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd
```

5. Add the user "postfix" to the group "sasl":
```bash
adduser postfix sasl
```

6. Restart saslauthd:
```bash
service saslauthd  restart
```

7. Edit Postfix configuration:
```bash
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname'
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes'
postconf -e 'broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes'
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous'
postconf -e 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination'
```

8. Restart postfix:
```bash
service postfix restart
```

### Step 4 - `Create user in SASL`

1. run `saslpasswd2` and type password you wish to use!
```bash
saslpasswd2 -c -u smtp.example.org username
```
*smtp.example.org*: is our own SMTP domain we have created in `step 0`

*username*: is our username to connect via it

2. Make sure our user got created:
```bash
sasldblistusers2
```

3. Test we can login by our new SMTP login detials:
```bash
testsaslauthd -u username -r smtp.example.org -p XXX
```
*username*: our username we created

*smtp.example.org*: our domain name we created

*XXX*: is our password we created


and You should get return of `0: OK "Success."`

## Conclusion

And this is it, you are done. Congrats now you own your inbox, sending and receiving emails to your *friends*. It's kind of hard yes i admit it but it's totally worth it, right?

If you have unexpected behaviors you can read logs, you will find postfix logs at `/var/log/mail.log` and SASL logs at `/var/log/auth.log`
