<!-- This where the actual tutorial begins. You don't need to write out the title again, having it in the frontmatter above is enough. -->

## Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to setup additional subnet on Xen server hosted by Hetzner. [Hetzner wiki](https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Citrix_XenServer/en#Configuration_of_an_additional_subnet) already contains configuration steps. But if you don't perform additional configuration as per this tutorial, xenserver network interface will send packets containing invalid autogenerated MAC addresses outside. This might happen because IP addresses from subnets provided by Hetzner are not associated with MAC addresses. Only separate IP addresses can have MAC addresses tied to them.

**Prerequisites**

Xenserver should be installed and configured on dedicated server ordered from Hetzner. Additional subnet should be ordered from Hetzner.

## Step 1 - Create additional network

```xe network-create name-label="Additional subnet" name-description="Additional subnet aa.xx.yy.zz/28"```

This command will create new network and bridge interface, by default named xapi0.

## Step 2 - Add first usable IP address of subnet to new bridge interface

Note: xapi0 bridge will not show up on host until at least one of VMs is assigned to new network in Xen Center as in Step 3.

```ip addr add aa.xx.yy.1/28 dev xapi0```

## Step 3 - Add virtual machines to new network

In Xen Center go to Networking-Properties tab to configure network interfaces of virtual machines.

## Conclusion

After completing above steps your subnet should be configured and working properly.
