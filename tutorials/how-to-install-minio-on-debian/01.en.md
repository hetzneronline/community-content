## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to install the open-source object storage server [MinIO](https://min.io/product/overview) on Debian. MinIO is a self-hosted object storage solution, ideal for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, and backups on your own server. It’s designed to be simple, scalable, and high-performance.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have MinIO up and running on your Debian server, accessible over the web.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic knowledge of using the terminal.
* A valid domain or IP address.
* A Debian server with root access.
* At least 1 GB of RAM and 2 CPUs for optimal performance.

## Step 1 - Update the system

Before installing MinIO, ensure your system is up-to-date:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2 - Install necessary dependencies

MinIO requires certain packages to be installed, such as `wget` to download files. Run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install wget -y
```

## Step 3 - Download and install MinIO

Now, download the MinIO binary file using `wget` and move it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
sudo mv minio /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
```

## Step 4 - Create a MinIO user

For security reasons, it's best to run MinIO under a dedicated user. Create one using the following command:

```shell
sudo useradd -r minio-user -s /sbin/nologin
sudo mkdir /home/minio-user
sudo chown minio-user:minio-user /home/minio-user
```

## Step 5 - Set up directories for MinIO

MinIO needs a directory to store data. Create this directory and adjust permissions:

```shell
sudo mkdir /data
sudo chown minio-user:minio-user /data
```

## Step 6 - Create a systemd service for MinIO

To run MinIO as a system service, create a new systemd unit file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/minio.service
```

Add the following content:

```text
[Unit]
Description=MinIO
Documentation=https://docs.min.io
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=minio-user
Group=minio-user
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/minio
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/minio server /data
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit the file.

## Step 7 - Configure environment variables

Create an environment file to define these:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/default/minio
```

Add your username and password:

```shell
MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin
```

Save and exit.

## Step 8 - Start and enable the MinIO service

Now, start MinIO and enable it to run at boot:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start minio
sudo systemctl enable minio
```

## Step 9 - Access MinIO web interface

MinIO will be running on port `9000` by default. Open your web browser and navigate to:

```shell
http://your_server_ip:9000
```

Log in using the access and secret keys you set earlier.

When you create buckets and add objects, you can see the data on your server in `/data`.

## Step 10 - Secure MinIO with HTTPS (Optional)

For production environments, it's recommended to enable HTTPS. To secure MinIO, you’ll need an SSL certificate.
* Obtain an SSL certificate using Let’s Encrypt or any other provider.
* Move the certificate and key files to `/home/minio-user/.minio/certs/`.
* Restart the MinIO service:

  ```shell
  sudo systemctl restart minio
  ```

Now, you can access MinIO over HTTPS.

### Conclusion

You’ve successfully installed and configured MinIO on Debian! You now have a powerful object storage server ready to use. For advanced configurations, including distributed setups, visit the [official MinIO documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html).
