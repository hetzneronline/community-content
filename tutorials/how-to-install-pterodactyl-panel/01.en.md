# How to install Pterodactyl Panel


## Introduction
This tutorial will show you how to install Pterodactyl Panel: a open source game panel that many server hosts use to manage up to thousands of servers. It is mostly centred around Minecraft, but can be used for other purposes as long as a "egg" is supplied. The panel can also control many daemons from a single panel. A daemon and the panel can run on the same system without issues. You can find more details about Pterodactyl Panel on its website: https://pterodactyl.io/

**Prerequisites**
The panel supports Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 7 (may require additional repositories) or 8, and Debian 9 (may require additional repositories) or 10. Make sure you are running one of these systems.

* All daemon hosts and the panel will need a dedicated IP
**Optional**
* A web domain

**For the panel that will control the daemons which control all the servers:**
* You will need PHP version `7.2` with the following extensions: `cli`, `openssl`, `gd`, `mysql`, `PDO`, `mbstring`, `tokenizer`, `bcmath`, `xml` (or `dom`), `curl`, `zip`, and `fpm`.
* MySQL (v`5.7` or higher), **or** MariaDB (v`10.1.13` or higher)
* Any webserver (`NGINX` recommended, and what will be used in this tutorial)
* `curl`, `tar`, `unzip`, `git`, and `composer`

**For each daemon:**
* `docker`
* NodeJS (either `v10` or `v12` works best)
* `node-gyp`
* `tar`
* `unzip`
* `make`, `gcc`
* `python`

Instructions on how to install these prerequisites will be in step 2.

**ALL COMMANDS SHOULD BE RUN AS ROOT OR PREFIXED WITH `sudo`!**

## Step 1 - Check your system hardware type
Docker will not run on certain virtualisation types. You need to check if you have one of these types that will not work.

* If you have a Dedicated Root Server, you do not need to worry about this and can continue to step 2.

* If you have a Cloud Server, run the following command and check its output:
```bash
lscpu | grep 'vendor\|type'
Hypervisor vendor:     VMware
Virtualization type:   full
```
If the first line (`Hypervisor vendor`) is `Virtuozzo`, `OpenVZ` (or `OVZ`), or `LXC`, you will not be able to run `docker` on this system. You can still install the panel, but the daemon must be hosted somewhere else.
If the first line is `VMWare` or `KVM`, the daemon will run perfectly fine on this system.
However, if the second line (`Virtualization type`) is not `full`, `docker` will not run. You must host the daemon somewhere else.

If the above command did not work, you can run the following one to check:
```bash
sudo dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
VMware, Inc.
```
So long as the above command did not return `Xen` or `LXC`, `docker` will most likely work.

## Step 2 - Install prerequisites

The following commands will install prerequisites for the panel (daemon prerequisites are below)

```bash
# Add "add-apt-repository" command
apt -y install software-properties-common curl

# Add additional repositories for PHP, Redis, and MariaDB
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php
add-apt-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/redis-server
curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash

# Update repositories list
apt update

# Add universe repository if you are on Ubuntu 18.04
apt-add-repository universe

# Install Dependencies
apt -y install php7.2 php7.2-cli php7.2-gd php7.2-mysql php7.2-pdo php7.2-mbstring php7.2-tokenizer php7.2-bcmath php7.2-xml php7.2-fpm php7.2-curl php7.2-zip mariadb-server nginx tar unzip git redis-server # May ask to set a root password for the databases: simply hit enter to continue without a password: this is safe as long as the port to the database is closed.

# Install composer (dependency manager for PHP)
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

**IF YOUR SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT `docker` (as discovered in step 1) DO NOT RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS!**

Executing the following commands will install the packages required for the panel and set them up on Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (most parts will work on any OS: check the comments to see if it will not):
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash # Installs docker: could take a while
systemctl enable docker # Only run this command if your system has systemd installed (Ubuntu 16 or up, Debian 8 or up, or CentOS 7 or up)

# The following code will not work on CentOS: you must use these instructions instead: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#enterprise-linux-and-fedora
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash - # Installs NodeJS
apt -y install nodejs make gcc g++
```

## Step 3 - Set up MySQL or MariaDB
Regardless of which one you chose, you will need to set up the DB (database).

*The databases only need to be set up once!* If you have already installed the panel, you can continue to step 5.

1. To begin setting the DB up, log in with the following command:
```bash
mysql -u root -p # If you set a root password while installing, type it in when it asks for a password. If you did not set a root password, hit enter to continue.
```
2. Next, we need to create a user for the panel. Begin by telling MySQL to use the SQL DB that stores such information, then create the user (don't forget to change the password!)
```sql
USE mysql;
CREATE USER 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'somePassword';
```
3. Then, we need to create a database for the panel to use with the following command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE panel;
```
4. Lastly, we need to give the panel user the correct permissions:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON panel.* TO 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
That completes the DB setup.


## Step 4 - Install the panel and set it up
**You only need one panel for any number of daemons**

If you already have installed the panel, you can skip to step 5.

1. Begin by running the following commands to set up the required directory layout for the panel:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/pterodactyl
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
```

**Make sure you are in `/var/www/pterodactyl` before running the following commands!**

2. The following commands will download and extract the panel. Once downloaded and extracted, it will set the correct permissions on the `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories: these directories store files and keep a cache available to speed up load times.
```bash
curl -Lo panel.tar.gz https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/download/v0.7.17/panel.tar.gz
tar --strip-components=1 -xzvf panel.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

3. Let's now create the default settings file, then install more dependencies, and finally, create a new application key (**ONLY RUN THIS COMMAND WHEN INITIALLY SETTING UP THE PANEL**)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan key:generate --force
```
⛔ **DANGER** ⛔

Make sure you backup your encryption key: `APP_KEY` in the `.env` file. If you lose this key, all data will be lost forever.

4. We now need to configure some more items. Run the following commands and answer any questions as needed:
```bash
php artisan p:environment:setup
php artisan p:environment:database
# If you do not have a email address to send from, you may safely skip this step: new users will need to be given their password manually, instead of through email.
php artisan p:environment:mail
```

5. Continue the setup by setting up the database:

⚠ *WARNING* ⚠

Do not exit this command or reboot the host system until this process exits: you run the risk of corrupting your database.
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

6. You're almost done setting up the panel: run the following command to set up a user:
*Passwords must be at least 8 characters long, with mixed case, and contain at least one number.*
```bash
php artisan p:user:make
```

7. Lastly, set up the correct permissions:
```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data * # For any OS except CentOS
```

Next, you will set up the queue listeners: these schedule tasks in the background, making Pterodactyl faster.
1. Run the following command to open your `crontab` file:
```bash
crontab -e # If asked to select a editor, press enter to accept the default.
```
2. Paste the following line into the file:
```
* * * * * php /var/www/pterodactyl/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
Press `Ctrl+X`, followed by `y`, then press enter to save the file.

3. Next, create a `systemd` worker to keep the process running in the background:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/pteroq.service
```
Paste these lines into the file that has been opened:
```
# Pterodactyl Queue Worker File
# ----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Pterodactyl Queue Worker

[Service]
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/pterodactyl/artisan queue:work --queue=high,standard,low --sleep=3 --tries=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Press `Ctrl+X`, followed by `y`, then press enter to save.

4. Run the following command to enable the queue worker:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now pteroq.service
```

5. To finish off the panel setup, let's set up the NGINX web server:
```bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf
```
If you're using SSL for your host, you can get some free certificates from Let's Encrypt (covered in step 7).

5a. If you are using SSL, paste the following lines into the file, replacing `<sub.example.com>` with your subdomain you have set up for the panel:
```
server_tokens off;

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <sub.example.com>;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name <sub.example.com>;

    root /var/www/pterodactyl/public;
    index index.php;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-access.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-error.log error;

    # allow larger file uploads and longer script runtimes
    client_max_body_size 100m;
    client_body_timeout 120s;

    sendfile off;

    # SSL Configuration
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<sub.example.com>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<sub.example.com>/privkey.pem;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384";
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # See https://hstspreload.org/ before uncommenting the line below.
    # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000; preload;";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Robots-Tag none;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'self'";
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header Referrer-Policy same-origin;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "upload_max_filesize = 100M \n post_max_size=100M";
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
        fastcgi_intercept_errors off;
        fastcgi_buffer_size 16k;
        fastcgi_buffers 4 16k;
        fastcgi_connect_timeout 300;
        fastcgi_send_timeout 300;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

5b. If you are not using SSL or a domain name, paste this into the file, replacing `<203.0.113.1>` with your domain or external dedicated IP:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <203.0.113.1>;

    root /var/www/pterodactyl/public;
    index index.html index.htm index.php;
    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    access_log off;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-error.log error;

    # allow larger file uploads and longer script runtimes
    client_max_body_size 100m;
    client_body_timeout 120s;

    sendfile off;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "upload_max_filesize = 100M \n post_max_size=100M";
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
        fastcgi_intercept_errors off;
        fastcgi_buffer_size 16k;
        fastcgi_buffers 4 16k;
        fastcgi_connect_timeout 300;
        fastcgi_send_timeout 300;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```
6. Run the following commands to install your NGINX configuration and restart NGINX:
```bash
# You do not need to symlink this file if you are using CentOS.
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf
systemctl restart nginx
```

You're done setting up the panel! You should be able to visit `<sub.example.com>` or `<203.0.113.1>` to access your panel. But your new panel is useless without a daemon or two to run servers on. Continue to the next step to get a daemon set up.

## Step 5 - Install and set up the daemon
You can install a daemon on the same server you installed your panel on without issues.

You should already have all the dependencies installed: if not, refer back to that section above.

1. Let's begin by creating and moving into the directories required.
```bash
mkdir -p /srv/daemon /srv/daemon-data
cd /srv/daemon
```
2. Next, download and unpack the daemon files:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/pterodactyl/daemon/releases/download/v0.6.13/daemon.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xzv
```

3. Install yet more dependencies for the daemon:

*You may see a line something like `found XX vulnerabilities` (where XX is a number): you can safely ignore it*
```bash
npm install --only=production --no-audit --unsafe-perm
```

Let's now set up and link the node on the panel.

4. Log on to your panel that you set up in the previous step, and click the gears in the top right corner, titled "Admin Control Panel".

5. On the sidebar, click "Locations", followed by "Create New" in the top right corner. Enter a short code in (best practice is to make it `XX.xxx` where `XX` is the country code, and `xxx` is the nearest airport's code.) and a description, then hit "Create". (**You only need to do this step the first time!**)

6. In the sidebar, press "Nodes", followed by "Create New" in the top right corner. Enter a unique name to identify this node, select a location to create this node at, set a memory limit (85% of total memory on the system will suffice, so long as other services are not running.), and a disk space limit (80% of the total disk space on the system). Set both "Memory Over-Allocation" and "Disk Over-Allocation" to 0. (**Every time you add a new node, you must do this step!**)

7a. If you set up the panel to use SSL, you must set up the node to use SSL. If you are running this node on the same system as the panel, you can set the FQDN to the same as the one you use to access the panel. If it is not on the same system, set up a subdomain pointing to the node's IP, and set that subdomain as the FQDN.

7b. If you did not set up the panel to use SSL, you can use either a IP or a domain name. Enter the subdomain, or the IP into the FQDN box, and select "Use HTTP Connection" under "Communicate Over SSL".

8. Once you have completed the above steps, press "Create Node". Select "Nodes" from the sidebar, select the node you just created,  choose the "Configuration" tab, then copy everything under the "Configuration File" section and paste it into `/srv/daemon/config/core.json`.

9. To apply the above changes, run the following command to start the daemon in foreground mode. Once it starts successfully, you can press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the process.
```bash
npm start
```

10. You'll most likely want to daemonize the process using `systemd`. Run the following command to open the service file:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/wings.service
```
Paste the following code into the file that just opened:
```
[Unit]
Description=Pterodactyl Wings Daemon
After=docker.service

[Service]
User=root
#Group=some_group
WorkingDirectory=/srv/daemon
LimitNOFILE=4096
PIDFile=/var/run/wings/daemon.pid
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /srv/daemon/src/index.js
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=600

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
11. Run the following command to reload `systemd` and boot up the daemon:
```bash
systemctl enable --now wings
```
12. You need some allocations to get servers running on this node! Switch back to the panel with the node open. Select the "Allocation" tab, then enter the IP address of the daemon's server in the "IP Address" field under the "Assign New Allocation" section. Enter a single port, or a range of ports, then press "Submit" at the bottom of the section.

You should now have a working node! To add a server to it, continue on to the next step.

## Step 6 - Create a server

1. Begin by logging on to your panel and clicking the gears in the top right to take you to the Admin Control Panel.
2. From the sidebar, select "Servers".
3. Press "Create New" in the top right corner.
4. Fill in the fields to your liking. Under "Default Allocation", select the port you want for the server. For a Minecraft server, you should default to port 25565. A good amount of RAM to choose for a single server is 8GB. The average Minecraft server with few players will rarely need more than 102,400MB of disk space. Be sure to select the "Paper" "Egg" under "Nest Configuration" if you plan to run a vanilla (meaning no mods, a player with the official launcher and no mods to the game can log on without issues) server. If you plan to run Forge, choose the "Forge Vanilla" egg. Scroll down to the bottom and hit the green "Create Server" button! You now have created a server on the open-source panel you installed!
5. Click the "Pterodactyl" text in the very top left corner to return to the home screen.
6. Select the server you just created from the list.
7. You will be taken to the server console menu, where you can enter commands to your new server.
8. To upload files, you can choose either the "File Management" section from the sidebar (this option has a limit of 100MB by default), or you can scroll down a little further under the sidebar to reveal the "Configuration" menu. Click this, then select "SFTP Settings". You will be taken to a page giving you a SFTP login for this server. All servers have unique SFTP logins, so if you create multiple, you will need another login for that server.
9. To restart your server after transferring files, you can click the "Console" option from the sidebar, scroll down a little ways, then press "Restart", "Stop", or "Kill". "Kill" should only be used as a last resort, as you risk corrupting your world save.

You now have a working server!

## Step 7 - Set up SSL certificates

1. Log in via SSH to your server.
2. Run the following commands to add the repositories for `certbot`, update them, and then install `certbot`. (`certbot` is a simple utility that makes it easy to auto-renew certificates).
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot
```
3. Stop your webserver
```bash
systemctl stop nginx
```
4. Create your certificate, replacing `<sub.example.com>` with the domain your panel is running on.
```bash
certbot certonly -d <sub.example.com>
```
5. Start your webserver again
```bash
systemctl start nginx
```
6. Set up autorenewal of your certificates. This is very important, do not skip this step!
Begin by opening your `crontab`
```bash
crontab -e
```
Then paste the following line into it at the end of the file (this sets up `certbot`'s renew function daily at midnight):
```
@daily certbot renew
```
Press `Ctrl+X`, followed by `y`, then press enter to save and exit.
You have successfully set up SSL certificates for your panel.

Occasionally, you can still get a `Insecure Connection` error when trying to connect to your panel: to remedy this, run the following commands which stop `nginx`, renew the certificates, then start `nginx` back up.
```bash
systemctl stop nginx
certbot renew
systemctl start nginx
```

## Conclusion
You have completed a full install of Pterodactyl Panel. Following all this intensive setup, you should reboot all systems with `reboot`. This may take a while for the system to reboot, as many things have been freshly installed. After a reboot, all servers on a node will be restored to the state they were in when the system shut down.
