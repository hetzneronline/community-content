## Introduction

In this tutorial i'm going to take you through on how to install pterodactyl.

**Prerequisites**

1 - Compatible Operating System: Pterodactyl Panel supports specific operating systems such as CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, or Debian 9/10. Make sure you have a compatible operating system installed on your server.

2 - Web Server: You will need a supported web server, either Apache or Nginx, installed on your server. The installation steps may vary slightly depending on the web server you choose.

3 - Required Packages: Make sure you have the necessary packages installed on your server. These packages typically include curl, tar, unzip, and git. You can use package managers like apt-get or yum to install these dependencies.

4 - SSH Access: Ensure that you have SSH access to your server. SSH will be used to download and configure the Pterodactyl Panel.

## Step 1 - Download and Install Dependencies

Start by downloading and installing the necessary dependencies for the Pterodactyl Panel.

1. Ensure that you have a compatible operating system (such as CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, or Debian 9/10) and a supported web server (Apache or Nginx) installed.

2. Install the required packages for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl tar unzip git
```

## Step 2 - Set Up the Pterodactyl Panel

Next, we'll set up the Pterodactyl Panel on your server.

1 - Access your server via SSH.

2 - Download the Pterodactyl installation script using the following command:
```shell
curl -Lo panel.tar.gz https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz
```

3 - Extract the downloaded archive:
```shell
tar --strip-components=1 -xzvf panel.tar.gz
```

4 - Install the panel dependencies using the package manager of your choice. For example, if you're using NPM, run:
```shell
npm install --only=production
```

5 - Generate the application key by running the following command:
```shell
php artisan key:generate --force
```

6 - Configure the panel by creating a new .env file using the provided example:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

7 - Open the .env file and modify the necessary settings, such as database connection details and application URLs. Save and close the file.

8 - Migrate the database by running the following command:
```shell
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

9 - Set the appropriate permissions for the storage directory:
```shell
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

10 - Generate a new application key:
```shell
php artisan key:generate --force
```

### Step 3 - Set Up a Web Server Configuration

Now, let's configure your web server to serve the Pterodactyl Panel.

Apache
1 - Create a new Apache configuration file for the panel:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf
```

2 - Add the following content to the file:
```html
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/pterodactyl/public

    <Directory /var/www/html/pterodactyl/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/pterodactyl_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/pterodactyl_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

3 - Save and close the file.

4 - Enable the new configuration and restart Apache:
```shell
sudo a2ensite pterodactyl.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Nginx
1 - Create a new Nginx configuration file for the panel:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf
```
2 - Add the following content to the file:
```javascript
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /var/www/html/pterodactyl/public;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

3 - Save and close the file.

4 - Enable the new configuration and restart Nginx:

```shell
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Pterodactyl Panel on your server. You can now access the panel using your server's domain or IP address in a web browser. Make sure to finalize the panel setup by following any additional instructions provided in the official Pterodactyl documentation.
