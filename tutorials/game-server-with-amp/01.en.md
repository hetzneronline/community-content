# Game server server with AMP

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will install [Outline](https://getoutline.org/) a VPN server developed by Jigsaw.

## Step 1 - Create a new Cloud server

* Login to your cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Create new project and name it whatever you want
* Choose your server location it's up to you
* Click `Add Server` and select `Ubuntu 18.04` from Image
* Choose the resources you need from Type
* Click on the field `User Data` enter this `#include https://get.docker.com` (this will install docker)
* Select your SSH-Key 
    * You can read [this](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article to know how to generate SSH key
* Write your server hostname in `name` input
* Click `Create & Buy Now`

## Step 2 - Install updates on the server (optional)

Wait a few seconds for the server to startup and then connect to it using SSH and your private key.
Now you should install available updates on your server by running:  

`apt update && apt upgrade -y`  

## Step 2.1 - Install Java (for Minecraft servers)

If you want to run a Minecraft server you will need to install java you can do so by executing:  
`apt install -y openjdk-8-jre`

## Step 3 - Install AMP

Now you want to install AMP, in order to do connect to your server via ssh and then execute:  
`sudo su -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://cubecoders.com/getamp.sh)"`  

This will setup AMP, you are going to be asked to choose a password for the `amp` user that AMP will run under. Please choose a secure password, directly after that you will need to choose te username and password for the AMP ADS instance (a web portal to create new instances (every game has its own instance)). Once this is done simply press y when asked if you want to install some packages needed for AMP.

## Step 4 - Connect to the panel

Now its time to open your browser and open `http://10.0.0.1:8080`. There you can login with the user and password you just choose. Directly after your login AMP will ask you for its `Operation Mode` since this is a single server install choose `Standalone (Default)`. Then enter your license key. Once entered press the big green `Restart AMP`button.

## Step 5 - Create a Game server instance

Click on `Create Instance` then in the `Application` dropdown select the game server you want (for example Minecraft Java Edition). In the field `Friendly Name (Optional)` you can give the server a name this is optional but can be nice. Please do not check the checkbox `Create as standalone (Not managed by ADS)` because this will make it impossible to manage the instace via the ADS webinterface.

## Step 6 - Connect to the instance

You should now see a new instance in the `local instances` block. It should have the colour red, click onto it and then select `Start Instance`. Now when you click on the `Manage` button you will see the AMP interface for that instance and be able to manage it.

## Step 7 - Make AMP start at boot

In order to make AMP start at boot you will have to type `crontab -e` then choose a editor for example `nano`, then when you scroll all the way down you have to add `@reboot /opt/cubecoders/amp/ampinstmgr -b` to the file. You can then exit and save by pressing `control+x` if you are asked if want to save press enter to confirm.

## Step 8 - Upgrade AMP

Sometimes comes the time where a new AMP version is release, in order to upgrade AMP the latest version simply run `ampinstmgr upgradeall`
