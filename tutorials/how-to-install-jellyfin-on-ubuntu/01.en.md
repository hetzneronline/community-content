## Introduction

> Jellyfin is a free and open-source media server which allows you to organize, save, and watch your own media, movies, TV shows, music, and much more, all from a web browser or one of Jellyfin's client apps. In this tutorial, I'll be walking you through how to install Jellyfin onto your Ubuntu server, and get it up-and-running so you can access your media from anywhere in the world!

**Prerequisites**

- An user that has `sudo` privileges.
- If a firewall is enabled (e.g., [Hetzner Console's firewall](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/firewalls/getting-started/creating-a-firewall) or UFW), ensure that TCP port `8096` is open.
    - Hetzner Console's firewall: `<your-project>` -> Firewalls -> Add an inbound rule for the TCP port `8096`
    - UFW: `sudo ufw allow 8096/tcp`

## Installation Pathway

There are 2 different ways that you can go about installing Jellyfin, covered individually by these steps:
- **Option 1**: Using the Jellyfin `bash` script
- **Option 2**: Installing Jellyfin manually

For beginners new to Jellyfin or Linux administration, I'd personally recommend Option 1 due to its simplicity, but you can choose whichever installation method you choose!

## Option 1 - Using the Jellyfin `bash` script

From personal experience, this is the easiest way to get Jellyfin installed, by far.

To start off with, it's always good practise to go ahead and update your package index files:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Next up, run Jellyfin's `bash` script:

```bash
curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
Found the following details from '/etc/os-release':
  Real OS:            ubuntu
  Repository OS:      ubuntu
  Repository Release: noble
  CPU Architecture:   amd64
If this looks correct, press <Enter> now to continue installing Jellyfin. 
```

Now, hit Enter on your keyboard, and Jellyfin should begin to install!

Once the installation is complete, you should be left with something like this:

```bash

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should see the service as 'active (running)' above. If not, use https://jellyfin.org/contact to find us for troubleshooting.

You can access your new instance now at http://<10.0.0.1>:8096 in your web browser to finish setting up Jellyfin.

Thank you for installing Jellyfin, and happy watching!
```

Finally, if all looks well here, then you should be able to navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:8096`, and be greeted with the Jellyfin setup screen!

> **Important**:
> Ensure your firewall is properly configured for Jellyfin beforehand.

## Option 2 - Installing Jellyfin manually

To start off with, it's always good practise to go ahead and update your package index files:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Next, install `curl`, as well as `gnupg`, if they aren't already installed:

```bash
sudo apt install curl gnupg
```

Now, we'll add the `universe` repository to get all the dependencies we need for FFmpeg:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Next, we need to download & setup Jellyfin's GPG signing keys:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.jellyfin.org/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/jellyfin.gpg
```

And finally, we now need to add a repository configuration for Jellyfin:

```bash
export VERSION_OS="$( awk -F'=' '/^ID=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release )"
export VERSION_CODENAME="$( awk -F'=' '/^VERSION_CODENAME=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release )"
export DPKG_ARCHITECTURE="$( dpkg --print-architecture )"
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.sources
Types: deb
URIs: https://repo.jellyfin.org/${VERSION_OS}
Suites: ${VERSION_CODENAME}
Components: main
Architectures: ${DPKG_ARCHITECTURE}
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/jellyfin.gpg
EOF
```

Now, we can update our package index files once again:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

And finally, we can install Jellyfin:

```bash
sudo apt install jellyfin-server jellyfin-web
```

Now that everything's installed, we can verify that all went well by checking the status of Jellyfin's `systemd` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jellyfin
```

You should see something along the lines of this:

```bash
holu@<your_host>:~$ systemctl status jellyfin
