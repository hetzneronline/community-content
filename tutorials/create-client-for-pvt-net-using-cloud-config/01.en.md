## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to add a new client server to a private Cloud Network with a self-hosted gateway. At server creation, we will use a cloud-config script which adds a new route to the server so that all **outgoing** traffic is sent to the Hetzner gateway (`10.0.0.1`). The Hetzner gateway then forwards this traffic to your self-hosted gateway. You don't need a public interface (no public IP address), or configure any static routes to your self-hosted gateway. If your gateway has a DNS server, it will be used by your new server.

**Prerequisites**

- **Self-hosted gateway** in your private Cloud Network

  > There is another [tutorial](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/how-to-route-cloudserver-over-private-network-using-pfsense-and-hcnetworks) available that covers the setup of a pfSense server as a gateway/firewall.

- This tutorial uses the "Ubuntu 22.04" image provided by Hetzner

**Example terminology**

- Private Network: `10.0.0.0/24`
- pfSense server: `10.0.0.2`
- DNS nameservers: `185.12.64.1` and `185.12.64.2`

## Step 1 - Prepare "netplan" configuration

We want cloud-config to create a file (`/etc/netplan/51-netcfg.yaml`) to set a default route.

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens10:
      dhcp4: true
      routes:
      - to: 0.0.0.0/0
        via: 10.0.0.1
```

`ens10` is the interface name of our private Network.
We need to send all outgoing traffic to the Hetzner gateway (`10.0.0.1`).
If you used the tutorial linked in "Prerequisites", the Hetzner gateway should already be configured to send all traffic to the pfSense server.

## Step 2 - Prepare "resolved" configuration

In this example, we are using Hetzner DNS servers, but you can also use other DNS servers. Change the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file:

```conf
[Resolve]
DNS=185.12.64.2 185.12.64.1
```

## Step 3 - Build the cloud-config script

Now we need to combine both configurations from the first two steps in one cloud-config script. After the two files were written, the cloud-config script will reboot the server.

```yaml
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /etc/netplan/51-netcfg.yaml
    permissions: '0644'
    content: |
      network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
          ens10:
            dhcp4: true
            routes:
            - to: 0.0.0.0/0
              via: 10.0.0.1
  - path: /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
    content: |
      [Resolve]
      DNS=185.12.64.2 185.12.64.1
runcmd:
  - reboot
```

## Step 4 - Create a new Server

Open the Hetzner [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) and create a new Ubuntu 22.04 server. Add the server to your private Network only. We don't need any public interfaces.

Use the cloud-config script from "Step 3". Make any necessary changes to fit your environment and paste it into the "Cloud config" configuration text box at the bottom of the wizard. Create your server and give it some time to reboot.

## Step 5 - Verify your configuration

If you have a VPN connection to your pfSense, you should be able to SSH into the created server.

If not, you need to use the [VNC console](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/vnc-console) in the Hetzner Cloud user interface [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/).

- **Verify DNS Server**
  
  ```bash
  resolvectl status
  ```
  
  You should see your configured DNS server.

- **Verify Default Route**
  
  ```bash
  ip route
  ```
  
  You should see a default route:
  
  ```
  default via 10.0.0.1 dev ens10 proto static onlink
  ```

## Conclusion

You have configured a new server with cloud-config to use the Hetzner gateway as a default route for outgoing traffic, and to use your own DNS servers.
