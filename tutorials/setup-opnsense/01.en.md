## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to install OPNsense on Hetzner Cloud

**Prerequisites**

- [Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
- hcloud-CLI (optinal)

## Choose a way you preferre :

We have two ways to install OPNsense:

- hCloud Console [Hetzner Cloud CLI](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
- Cloud Web GUI [Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)

I preferre the Web GUI but you choose gonna choose.

## Step 1: Go to Hetzner Cloud and create a new project

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\h-cloud.png|]]

1. Select new project and create a project name
   [[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\projectname.png|]]

2. Select your project
   [[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\project.png|]]

3. add server
   [[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\add_server.png|]]

## Step 2: Select the Intel server you want to use

- [OPNsense hardware requirements](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/hardware.html)

So now you have to select an server that has an Intel CPU because we need Intels "AES-NI"

Server with Intel CPUs are labeld with "CX"

1.  Select location

2.  Select OS image (it doesn't matter which one you choose, because we'll delete it anyway)

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\location-os-image.png|]]

3.  Choose the type but as I said, we need a server with Intel CPU (CX)
    A CX11 as router is enough for the purpose.

4.  Order now and wait until you can access the server

## Step 3: Install OPNsense

1. Select the server you ordered and go to the 'ISO Images Tab'

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\iso-images.png|]]

2. Search for OPNsense ISO Image and attach it

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\search-iso.png|]]

3. Enable Webconsole and restart the server

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\enable-webconsole.png|]]

OPNsense will now autoboot and you wait until this shows up

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\wait-until-this.png|]]

Now you can login as installer user to install OPNsense

username: installer
password: opnsense

select your keyboard layout and continue.

Now select Install (UFS) and then select the disk you want to install it on

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\install-disk.png|]]

Wait until the installation is completed

4. Exit Installer setup and detach the iso image

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\exit-installer.png|]]

5. Wait until the system booted and login

username: root
password: opnsense

6. Select Assign interfaces

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\assign-inet.png|]]

Do you want to configure VLANs now? (default "N"): Press Enter

Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for auto: choose "vtnet0" or what you see under Valid interfaces
If you are not sure, choose "a" for auto-detection

Skip the LAN and Optional interface part by pressing Enter and proceed with "y"

## Step 4: Access Web GUI

You can now access the web gui with the server IPV4 Address

Browser -> https://<your-server-ipv4>

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\web-gui.png|]]

login with the default login

username: root
password: opnsense

Complete the Setup Wizard:

[[/tutorials\setup-opnsense\img\web-setup-wizard.png|]]

And you are done.

You have to do the rest of the configuration yourself, since everyone has different network settings etc.
and does not want or want this and that. I can only recommend the official documentation from OPNsense.

## Conclusion

This article shows the necessary steps for setting up a OPNsense server with Hetzner Cloud.
