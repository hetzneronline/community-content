## Introduction

AWX is the upstream project of Ansible Tower, which provides a central service to manage your Ansible runs with.
It is especially useful for bigger environments, but even smaller environments can benefit from using AWX.

Sadly, since version 18.0.0, deploying AWX to a single host is no longer supported and Kubernetes should be used instead.
However, in some cases (especially smaller setups), you want to run AWX without the overhead Kubernetes provides.

This guide covers the setup and basic configuration of AWX on Ubuntu 20.04, however, it should work just fine on other distributions with only minor changes.

## Requirements

The [Ansible Tower documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/installandreference/requirements_refguide.html) states the following minimum requirements:

* 2 CPU cores
* 4 GB RAM
* 20 GB storage

A Hetzner cloud server of type CX21 neatly fits those requirements (we even get more storage than we need).
Any other, bigger cloud server (or even bare metal) would also work, but we're choosing a CX21 for this guide.

## Step 1 - Setting up the server

For the sake of simplicity, we expect you to already have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 on your server.

### Step 1.1 - Configuring the firewall

First up, we want to configure some basic Firewall rules for our server.
When using a cloud server, you can use the integrated Firewall feature.

The following inbound Firewall rules should be configured:

| Source | Protocol | Port | Comment |
|:---:|:---:| ---:|:---:|
| Any | ICMP | - | Ping |
| Any | TCP | 22 | SSH |
| Any | TCP | 80 | HTTP |
| Any | TCP | 443 | HTTPS |

### Step 1.2 - Installing required packages

As user `root`, execute the following commands:

```bash=
# Update host OS, just in case...
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install packages required to install docker
apt install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

# Grab and install the Docker Archive GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add apt repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

# Update package cache
apt update

# Install docker and docker-compose
apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose

# Install other required packages
apt install -y git ansible make nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

## Step 2 - Installing AWX

### Step 2.1 - Creating AWX user

As user `root`, run the following commands to configure the user that will be used to manage AWX:

```bash=
# Create user
useradd -s /bin/bash -md /opt/awx awx
# Allow user awx to use docker
gpasswd -a awx docker
```

### Step 2.2 - Checkout AWX repository

To install AWX, we first need to clone the git repository.
It contains some useful scripts that make running it locally quite a bit easier.

First, switch to the newly created `awx` user (e.g. `su - awx`).

At the time of writing, version `19.2.1` was the latest version.
You can find the current latest version [on their releases page](https://github.com/ansible/awx/releases/latest).
Replace `19.2.1` with whatever is the latest version when you're running this command.

Additionally, we clone the `awx-logos` repository to replace the placeholder images with the official AWX logos.

```bash=
git clone -b 19.2.1 https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx-logos.git
```

### Step 2.3 - Configuring AWX

Now that we grabbed the latest version of AWX, it's time to configure it.
We want to create our own branch to simplify merging our changes with later versions of AWX.

This can be done with the following command:

```bash=
cd awx
git switch -c my_awx # Name can be anything
```

First, we copy the respective assets from the `awx-logos` repository into AWX:

```bash=
cp /opt/awx/awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/favicon.ico \
   /opt/awx/awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/logo-header.svg \
   /opt/awx/awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/logo-login.svg \
   awx/ui_next/public/static/media/
```

Once that's done, we want to start editing our config files.
As a baseline, you want to set the hostname you're running AWX on and disable Debug-mode.

Replace `awx.example.com` with the hostname used for AWX:

```bash=
# Set hostname
echo "CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['awx.example.com']" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py
echo "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['awx.example.com']" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py

# Disable debug mode
echo "DEBUG = False" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py
```

Depending on your setup, you might want to change additional options.
For example, if you want to use an external PostgreSQL database, you can configure it in `tools/docker-compose/inventory`.
Once all changes are done, you want to commit them.
For that, you might need to configure your git identity.

You can do so with:

```bash=
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Since we don't need to run any codestyle checks, we bypass those with `AWX_IGNORE_BLACK=1`:

```bash=
git add .
AWX_IGNORE_BLACK=1 git commit -m "AWX config changes"
```

### Step 2.4 - Building docker image

Building the docker image is as easy as it gets.
Simply run the following command and grab a coffee (building the image might takes a few minutes).

```bash=
make docker-compose-build
```

### Step 2.5 - Running AWX

#### Step 2.5.1 - Rendering docker-compose manifest

To render the docker-compose manifest for AWX:

```bash=
make docker-auth awx/projects docker-compose-sources
```

#### Step 2.5.2 - Generating UI files

By default, a source deployment of AWX comes without UI files, so we have to build them.
Keep in mind that this does take several minutes, depending on your server.

```bash=
docker-compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml run --rm awx_1 make clean-ui ui-devel
```

#### Step 2.5.3 - Running AWX

Once the UI files have been built, we can start AWX with docker-compose:

```bash=
docker-compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Upon the first run, AWX will apply database migrations, which might take a while.
You can check the progress with `docker logs tools_awx_1`.

Once AWX is ready, we want to change the password for the `admin` user:

```bash=
docker exec -ti tools_awx_1 awx-manage changepassword admin
```

AWX is now configured and should be running.
But we're not quite done yet...

## Step 3 - Configuring Nginx

This one should be quite easy, so we're not going into greater detail here.
However, it basically boils down to the following steps (as user `root`):

### Step 3.1 - Creating Nginx config

In this example, I have the following configuration as the **only** contents of `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.
Depending on your setup, you might want to change things a bit.

```nginx=
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name awx.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host      $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_pass                 http://localhost:8013;
    }
}
```

After changing your nginx config, reload it with `systemctl reload nginx`

### Step 3.2 - Setting up certbot for Let's Encrypt certificates

This one is particularly easy.
Simply run `certbot` and follow the instructions on-screen.
By default, you should be able to leave everything as-is.
At the very end, when you're asked if you want to set up a redirect, select option 2 (set up redirect).

## Step 4 - Finishing touches / extras

### Step 4.1 - Settings in the AWX frontend

Once AWX is up and running, you want to change some additional settings in the frontend.
Visit `https://awx.example.com/#/settings/miscellaneous_system/details` and set the options below.
Don't worry about the logo. This is the official development logo by AWX, as you apparently can't use the real logo due to trademark restrictions.

* Adjust `Base URL of the service`
* Add `"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"` to `Remote Host Headers`

### Step 4.2 - Extra: Upgrading AWX

Upgrading AWX is quite straightforward and takes just a few minutes.

First, you want to fetch the latest changes from the git repository. As user `awx`, run these commands. Make sure to replace `X.Y.Z` with the latest version from the [AWX releases page](https://github.com/ansible/awx/releases/latest).

```bash=
cd /opt/awx/awx
git fetch --all --tags
git merge X.Y.Z
```

After that, simply repeat step 2.4 (Build docker image), stop AWX with the command below, and repeat step 2.5 (Running AWX).
That's all you need to do to upgrade AWX to the latest version.
Just keep in mind that the first start might take a bit longer again, as there might be database migrations that need to be applied.

### Step 4.3 - Extra: Systemd unit

In order to make things a bit easier, we can create a systemd unit to control AWX.

The following unit serves as an example,you might want to change it according to your needs:

```=
[Unit]
Description=AWX service (using docker-compose)
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
User=awx
WorkingDirectory=/opt/awx/awx
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml down

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Write it to `/etc/systemd/system/awx.service` and enable with `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable awx`.

## Conclusion

You've now set up your very own AWX instance.

Your next steps will probably be to further configure it by adding your inventory and linking it with your git repositories containing your playbooks. Once you've configured those two things, you should be ready to run your very first play on AWX.

In general, the [Ansible Tower User Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/userguide/index.html) is a good way to learn more about AWX, even if the UI differs slightly between AWX and Ansible Tower.
