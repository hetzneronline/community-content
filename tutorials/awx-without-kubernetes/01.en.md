## Introduction

AWX is an open source community project which provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of Ansible. It is the cutting-edge upstream for Ansible Controller, and enables users to better control their usage of Ansible in IT environments.
It is especially useful for bigger environments, but even smaller environments can benefit from using AWX.

Sadly, since version 18.0.0, deploying AWX to a single host is no longer supported and Kubernetes should be used instead.
However, in some cases (especially smaller setups), you want to run AWX without the overhead Kubernetes provides.

This guide covers the setup and basic configuration of AWX on Ubuntu 20.04, however, it should work just fine on other distributions with only minor changes.

## Requirements

The [Ansible Tower Installation and Reference Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.6/html/installandreference/requirements_refguide.html) states the following minimum requirements:

* 2 CPU cores
* 4 GB RAM
* 20 GB storage

A Hetzner cloud server of type CX21 neatly fits those requirements (we even get more storage than we need).
Any other, bigger cloud server (or even bare metal) would also work, but we're choosing a CX21 for this guide.

You will also need a domain name pointing to the server's IP address.
And root access to the server.

## Step 1 - Setting Up the Server

For the sake of simplicity, we expect you to already have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 on your server.

### Step 1.1 - Configuring the Firewall

First up, we want to configure some basic Firewall rules for our server.
When using a cloud server, you can use the integrated Firewall feature.

The following inbound permissive Firewall rules should be configured:

| Source | Protocol | Port | Comment |
| :----: | :------: | ---: | :-----: |
|  Any   |   ICMP   |    - |  Ping   |
|  Any   |   TCP    |   22 |   SSH   |
|  Any   |   TCP    |   80 |  HTTP   |
|  Any   |   TCP    |  443 |  HTTPS  |

### Step 1.2 - Installing Required Packages

#### Docker Engine

The following commands will configure APT for the Docker repository:

```console
apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
mkdir -v -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
```

Now, install Docker Engine with the following commands:

```console
apt update
apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

#### Additional Packages

We will also need some additional packages from the Ubuntu repository. Install them with the following command:

```console
apt install git ansible make nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx python3-setuptools-scm python3.9
```

### Step 1.3 - Creating Systemd Unit

To make things a bit easier, we can create a systemd unit to control AWX.

Create a systemd service unit file `/etc/systemd/system/awx.service` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=AWX service (using Docker Compose)
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
User=awx
WorkingDirectory=/opt/awx/awx
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml down

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After that, run the following commands to enable the new systemd service:

```console
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable awx
```

After you complete the instructions in the next section ([Step 2 - Installing AWX](#step-2---installing-awx)), you will be able to start/stop awx with commands:

```console
systemctl start awx
systemctl stop awx
```

## Step 2 - Installing AWX

### Step 2.1 - Creating AWX User

Run the following command to add a new user that will be used to manage AWX:

```console
useradd -s /bin/bash -m -d /opt/awx awx
```

* `-s /bin/bash` — Set login shell to `/bin/bash` for interactive login.
* `-m` — Create a home directory.
* `-d /opt/awx` — Use custom home directory path.
* `awx` — Login name.

And then add that user to the `docker` group:

```console
gpasswd -a awx docker
```

### Step 2.2 - Checkout AWX Repository

To install AWX, we first need to clone the git repository.
It contains some useful scripts that make running it locally quite a bit easier.

First, switch to the newly created `awx` user. You can do that with this command:

```console
su - awx
```

At the time of writing, version `21.10.0` was the available latest version.
You can find the latest version on [AWX releases page](https://github.com/ansible/awx/releases).
Replace `21.10.0` with whatever is the latest version when you're running this command.

Additionally, we clone the `awx-logos` repository to replace the placeholder images with the official AWX logos.

```console
git clone -b 21.10.0 https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx-logos.git
```

### Step 2.3 - Configuring AWX

Now that we grabbed the latest version of AWX, it's time to configure it.
We want to create our own branch to simplify merging our changes with later versions of AWX.

This can be done with the following command:

```console
cd awx
git switch -c my-awx
```

* `switch` — A git command to switch between branches.
* `-c <new-branch-name>` — Specifies a branch name to be created and switched.

First, we copy the respective assets from the `awx-logos` repository into AWX:

```console
cp ../awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/favicon.ico \
   ../awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/logo-header.svg \
   ../awx-logos/awx/ui/client/assets/logo-login.svg \
   awx/ui/public/static/media/
```

Once that's done, we want to start editing our config files.
As a baseline, you want to set the hostname you're running AWX on and disable Debug-mode.
Do not forget to replace `awx.example.com` with the hostname used for AWX:

```console
echo "CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['awx.example.com']" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py
echo "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['awx.example.com']" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py
echo "DEBUG = False" >> tools/docker-compose/ansible/roles/sources/files/local_settings.py
```

Depending on your setup, you might want to change additional options.
For example, if you want to use an external PostgreSQL database, you can configure it in `tools/docker-compose/inventory`.
Once all changes are done, you want to commit them.
For that, you might need to configure your git identity.

You can do so with:

```console
git commit -m "AWX config changes"
```

### Step 2.4 - Building Docker Image

Building the image for Docker is as easy as it gets.
Simply run the following command and grab a coffee (building the image might take a few minutes).

```console
make docker-compose-build
```

### Step 2.5 - Rendering Docker Compose Manifest

To render the Docker Compose manifest for AWX:

```console
make awx/projects docker-compose-sources
```

### Step 2.6 - Generating UI Files

By default, a source deployment of AWX comes without UI files, so we have to build them.
Keep in mind that this does take several minutes, depending on your server.

```console
docker compose -f tools/docker-compose/_sources/docker-compose.yml run --rm awx_1 make clean-ui ui-devel
```

### Step 2.7 - Running AWX

Once the UI files have been built, we can start AWX with:

```console
systemctl start awx
```

Upon the first run, AWX will apply database migrations, which might take a while.
You can check the progress with

```console
journalctl -f -u awx
```

If you see repeated errors about **inotify watches**

```text
Failed to watch /awx_devel/awx; upper limit on inotify watches reached!
```

then increase the amount of inotify watches with the following commands:

```console
echo 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' > /etc/sysctl.d/99-awx.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-awx.conf
```

Once AWX is ready, we want to change the password for the `admin` user:

```console
docker exec -ti tools_awx_1 awx-manage changepassword admin
```

AWX is now configured and should be running.
But we're not quite done yet...

## Step 3 - Configuring Nginx

This one should be quite easy, so we're not going into greater detail here.
However, it boils down to the following steps (as user `root`):

### Step 3.1 - Creating Nginx Config

In this example, I have the following configuration as the **only** contents of `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.
Depending on your setup, you might want to change things a bit.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name awx.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host      $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_pass                 http://localhost:8013;
    }
}
```

After changing your nginx config, reload it with

```console
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 3.2 - Setting Up Certbot for Let’s Encrypt Certificates

This one is particularly easy.
Simply run `certbot` and follow the instructions on-screen.
By default, you should be able to leave everything as-is.
At the very end, when you're asked if you want to set up a redirect, select option **2** (set up redirect).

## Step 4 - Finishing Touches / Extras

### Step 4.1 - Settings in the AWX Front-end

Once AWX is up and running, you want to change some additional settings in the front end.
Visit `https://awx.example.com/#/settings/miscellaneous_system/details` and set the options below.
Don't worry about the logo.
This is the official development logo by AWX, as you apparently can't use the real logo due to trademark restrictions.

* Adjust the `Base URL of the service`
* Add `"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"` to `Remote Host Headers`

### Step 4.2 - Extra: Upgrading AWX

Upgrading AWX is quite straightforward and takes just a few minutes.

First, you need to stop AWX:

```console
systemctl stop awx
```

After that, fetch the latest changes from the git repository.
As user `awx`, run these commands.
Make sure to replace `X.Y.Z` with the latest version from the [AWX releases page](https://github.com/ansible/awx/releases).

```console
cd /opt/awx/awx
git fetch --all --tags
git merge X.Y.Z
```

After that, simply repeat the following sections:
- [Step 2.4 - Building Docker Image](#step-24---building-docker-image)
- [Step 2.5 - Rendering Docker Compose Manifest](#step-25---rendering-docker-compose-manifest)
- [Step 2.6 - Generating UI Files](#step-26---generating-ui-files)

Finally, you can start the new version:

```console
systemctl start awx
```

Just keep in mind that the first start might take a bit longer again, as there might be database migrations that need to be applied.

That's all you need to do to upgrade AWX to the latest version.

## Conclusion

You've now set up your very own AWX instance.

Your next steps will probably be to further configure it by adding your inventory and linking it with your git repositories containing your playbooks.
Once you've configured those two things, you should be ready to run your very first play on AWX.

In general, the [Ansible Tower User Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.6/html/userguide/index.html) is a good way to learn more about AWX, even if the UI differs slightly between AWX and Ansible Tower.
