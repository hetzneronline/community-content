# konsoleH: SSH access

## Introduction - What is SSH?

SSH stands for Secure Shell.

With SSH you can access a server via command line on which you are able to execute commands.

**Prerequisites**
- konsoleH customer login
- An account with SSH access (e.g. [Level 19](https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting/level-19))

## SSH programs

There are countless SSH applications available for download from the internet. Recommended programs are, for example:

- OpenSSH (pre-installed on Linux, Windows, Mac)
- [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
- [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/)

## Access details

In konsoleH you can find the SSH access details under `Contract` -> `View Account Details` -> `SSH access`.

There you will find something similar to the following:

Host name: wwwXXX.your-server.de (Server IP: 10.0.0.1)
SSH-Port: 222
Login: holu
Password: *********
Connection identifier: ssh holu@wwwXXX.your-server.de -p222

Note: If you have a [Managed Server](https://www.hetzner.com/managed-server) you have to replace `www` with `dedi`.

## Selecting your own password

Your SSH password is the same as your FTP password. You can change it under `Services` -> `Login data` -> `Edit`.

An SSH password should fulfill some requirements for increased security. Please find these rules when changing the password.

To change the SSH/FTP password, simply enter your new password in the relevant text box and click `Save`.

## Connection via SSH

In order to ensure a proper SSH connection you should always use the servername and the port 222.

### OpenSSH

OpenSSH is a command line application which has no GUI. We can execute the following command to connect to the server:

```bash
ssh holu@wwwXXX.your-server.de -p222
```

### PuTTY

1. Start PuTTY
2. Enter the hostname in the text box and change the `Port` from `22` to `222` behind the `Host Name` text box.
3. Enter a name under `Saved Sessions`
4. Click on `Save`

We now have saved the SSH connection details and can always use it in the future.

5. Click on `Open` in the bottom right.
6. Click on `Accept` to accept the SSH server key
7. Enter your username (in this tutorial it is `holu`)
8. Enter the password you have selected (or the one you found pre-configured in konsoleH)

We are now connected to the server and can look around and execute commands via SSH.

**Known errors with PuTTY:**
- Server refused to start a shell/command
        - Solution: Set port to `222`

- Server refused to allocate pty
        - Solution: Set port to 222

- PuTTY closes without any error
        - Solution: You probably do not have an account with enabled SSH access
