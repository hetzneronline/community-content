## Introduction

This is a tutorial on how to install Hestia Control Panel. It's an easy dashboard to manage all your websites, mail servers and more.
It has many one-click apps to install such as Wordpress, making starting a new website easy. You can see a demo [here](https://demo.hestiacp.com:8083/).

**Prerequisites**

* A brand new server with one of the following operating systems:
  * Debian 9
  * Debian 10
  * Debian 11
  * Ubuntu 18.04
  * Ubuntu 20.04
* (Optional, but recommended) A domain name  

<!--Example terminology that you can use in the tutorial:

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>` and `<2001:db8:1234::1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>` and `<2001:db8:1234::ffff>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>` and `<2001:db8:9abc::1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>` and `<2001:db8:5678::1>`-->

## Step 1 - Starting installation

First, you need to get access to the command line of your server by typing `ssh username@hostname`. If you aren't already logged in as root, type `sudo su` and enter your password.

Next, run the following commands:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh
bash hst-install.sh
```
It will install the dependencies, then you should see this screen

Type 'y' for 'yes', then press enter

## Step 2 - Installation Steps

Next, it will ask you for the admin email address, and the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

The admin email address will be the email you use for the admin account of the panel. You will also get notified of some other things via this address such as SSL Certificate Expiry notifications.

The FQDN is the domain name you will use to access the panel. If you don't have a domain name, enter your server's IP address. If you do have a domain name, create an A record in your domain provider's DNS settings for your domain name, and point it to your server's IP address.

Now, after you've entered these details, sit back and wait for the installation to finish. It's usually pretty quick, but can sometimes take up to 15 minutes or longer.

## Step 3 - Logging into the panel

Congratulations! You've installed the panel. To login, visit panel.example.com:8083 (replacing panel.example.com with the FQDN you entered earlier, or your IP address).

Login with the credentials printed in the console.

## Step 4 (Optional) - Creating a website

To make a new website, log on to your panel and click the 'Web' tab at the top

Now, click on the Add Web Domain. If it warns you about creating websites on an admin account, it is safe to ignore. Now, enter the domain name (make sure there is an A record in your DNS settings with this domain pointing to your webserver).

Hover over your new domain and press the pencil to edit it.

## Step 3 - <Summary of Step> (Optional)

More instructions.

## Step N - <Summary of Step>

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
