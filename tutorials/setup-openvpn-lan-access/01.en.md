## Introduction

Having a personal lab to practice, deploy, and destroy stuff is an amazing experience. However, ensuring that the lab we have set up doesn't go to waste because we didn't put security measures in place is not a good feeling. Thus one of the things that one could do to ensure that only authorized people have access to the systems running in LAN is, setting up a VPN gateway.

So as shown in the diagram above, this is what my current setup looks like. I have an OpenVPN Server in one of the VMs, whose connection port is forwarded to the primary virtualization server to be available from the internet. I use OpenVPN client on my desktop to connect to this port and access the VPN connection. Now let's move on to the part where we set these things up.

## Step 1

Create a new VM in your virtualization software. Choose any OS of your preference; however, I am using an RHEL machine with 1 CPU and 1 GB Ram for my use case.

As evident it barely uses 1 GB ram even after everything is setup.

## Step 2

Once we have the target machine up and running, we will set up the OpenVPN server. As I was the only one who connected to this machine, I chose "OpenVPN Access Server" as my preferred solution. Its free license allows 2 concurrent sessions, which were more than enough for my use case.

To setup OpenVPN AS, follow the steps provided [here](https://openvpn.net/download-open-vpn/), look for "Access Server Software packages." Follow the steps as defined for the operating system of your choice.

## Step 3

SSH into the OpenVPN machine and reset the password for the openvpn user, this step is necessary else, you won't be able to login to the console.

```bash
$ sudo passwd openvpn
```

Now with a VM with UI (Windows machine or Linux with DE) go to the OpenVPN server URL i.e. `https://IP_ADDRESS:943/admin` and login with the `openvpn` account and password, set in the previous step.

## Step 4

Now let's set things up to ensure that we have access to the LAN, but complete traffic from our machine doesn't go through the server.

First, let's go to the Network Settings under Configuration and change the "Hostname or IP Address." The value in that textbox should be the public IP address of the virtualization server.

Next, we'll change the settings to access the LAN and discourage our internet traffic traveling through this VPN.

![OpenVPN Access Server Settings](image-3-1024x500.png)

We'll go to the VPN settings under the same configuration menu and put in the private IP address space we need access to. For me, it was `10.0.0.0/8` as all my network interfaces are running this IP range; yours could be different. Another thing, make sure that the "Should client Internet traffic be routed through the VPN?" switch should be set to NO. This will ensure only our LAN access is routed, but the internet goes through the normal gateway.

## Step 5

Download the connection keys. Go to `https://IP_ADDRESS:943/` and log in with the OpenVPN credentials and download the `client.ovpn` file and transfer it to your machine, from where you plan to connect to this VPN server; ideally, it would be your personal desktop, but it can be any machine, even a mobile phone.

## Step 6

Forward the LAN OpenVPN port to the Virtualization Server's Internet port. This can be done using `socat` and `tmux`

Launch a new tmux session with tmux command; if not present, install tmux for your distro. Once in the tmux window, run the following command for port forwarding.

```bash
$ sudo socat TCP-LISTEN:$$INTERNET_PORT_NUMBER$$,fork,reuseaddr TCP:$$OPENVPN_SERVER_IP$$:$$SERVER_PORT$$
```

Usually the OpenVPN server port is 1194 but it can be reconfigured to be anything else.

## Step 7

Once this setup is complete, use the OVPN file downloaded earlier and the OpenVPN Connect Client, to be downloaded from [here](https://openvpn.net/download-open-vpn/) to connect to the OpenVPN server and thus have access to all the LAN machines.

## Conclusion

This concludes our setup of OpenVPN Access Server in our Hetzner Server.

## NOTE

If you have multiple NICs running different IP address ranges, attach them to the OpenVPN server. In my case, I have 5 NICs running on 10.X.0.0/24; thus, I attached all of them to the OpenVPN server to get access to all the machines.
