## Introduction

⚠️ **Note:** This tutorial only installs the **web interface** of Pelican Panel.
To provision and manage actual game servers, you **must also install [Wings](https://pelican.dev/docs/wings/install)** on your target machines.

Pelican Panel is a modern, open-source game server management panel designed for containerized environments. Built with Laravel and Docker, it provides a powerful web interface for deploying and managing game servers.

This guide explains how to install and configure Pelican Panel on a server running Ubuntu 24.04.

**Prerequisites**

* A server with Ubuntu 24.04
* Root or sudo privileges
* A registered domain name pointing to the server’s IP address
* Basic familiarity with Linux command-line operations

**Example terminology**

* Username: `holu`
* Domain: `example.com`

## Step 1 - Update the System

Start by updating your package index and upgrading any existing packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

This ensures compatibility and applies security patches.

## Step 2 - Install Required Software

* **Add the PHP Repository**
  
  Add the `ondrej/php` PPA to access PHP 8.2 and related extensions:
  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php -y
  sudo apt update
  ```

<br>

* **Install Required Packages**
  
  Install NGINX, MySQL, PHP 8.2, and supporting modules required by Laravel:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y \
    nginx mysql-server sqlite3 \
    php8.2 php8.2-cli php8.2-common php8.2-mysql php8.2-sqlite3 php8.2-fpm \
    php8.2-mbstring php8.2-xml php8.2-bcmath php8.2-curl php8.2-zip php8.2-gd php8.2-intl \
    curl git unzip software-properties-common
  ```

## Step 3 - Configure MySQL

Secure the database server:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Then create a database and user for Pelican:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Inside the MySQL shell:

> Replace `YourSecurePassword` with a strong, unique password. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 20`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pelican;
CREATE USER 'pelicanuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourSecurePassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pelican.* TO 'pelicanuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

## Step 4 - Install Docker

Pelican uses Docker to isolate game environments. Install Docker Engine and its dependencies as explained in the official Docker documentation:

* [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

Enable and start the Docker service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Optionally, add your user to the Docker group:

> Replace `holu` with your actual username.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker holu
```

You may need to log out and back in for changes to take effect.

## Step 5 -  Install Composer

Composer is used to manage PHP dependencies. Install it globally:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

## Step 6 - Download and Install Pelican Panel

Create a directory and extract the panel files:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/pelican
cd /var/www/pelican
curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
```

Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/pelican
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/pelican
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

## Step 7 - Configure the Application

Pelican provides an setup command:

```bash
php artisan p:environment:setup
```

## Step 8 - Set Permissions

Ensure proper ownership and access permissions for Laravel to function correctly:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/pelican/storage /var/www/pelican/bootstrap/cache
```

Secure the environment file:

```bash
sudo chmod 640 /var/www/pelican/.env
```

## Step 9 - Configure SSL with Certbot

Install Certbot via Snap to enable HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt install snapd -y
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com
```

Enable automatic certificate renewal:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable snap.certbot.renew.timer
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## Step 10 - Configure NGINX

Remove the default configuration:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Create a new configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pelican.conf
```

Paste the following, replacing `example.com` accordingly:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/pelican/public;
    index index.php;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart NGINX:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pelican.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 11 - Complete the Web Installer

Navigate to your domain in a browser:

```
https://example.com/installer
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create an administrator account and complete the setup.

When it asks about the database information, use the information from step 3. In this example, we used:

* Database Driver: MySQL
* Database Name: pelican
* Database Username: pelicanuser
* Database Password: YourSecurePassword'

## Conclusion

* Ensure the following services are active and enabled:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  sudo systemctl status php8.2-fpm
  sudo systemctl status docker
  ```

* Consider securing your server with UFW:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install ufw
  sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
  sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
  sudo ufw enable
  ```

* Keep your system and Pelican Panel updated to receive security patches and new features.
