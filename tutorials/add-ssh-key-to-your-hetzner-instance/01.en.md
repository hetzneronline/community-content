## Introduction

In order to access in a safe way to your Hetzner Instance from your local computer, it is recommended to make use of a SSH Key. In this tutorial I will gide you how to setup the secure login with your SSH Key on a new Hetzner Instance.

**Prerequisites**

- A Hetzner Cloud Account.
- Permissions for creating a Hetzner Project and a Hetzner instance.
- ssh-keygen, cat and pbcopy installed on your local computer.

## Step 1 - Creating your local SSH Key

- You need to create a SSH Key on your local machine. It is recommended to add a comment at the end in order to indentify the SSH Key in the future. Some information about the computer itself should be usefull. For example `SSH-Key - MacbookPro 13 Inch - helmer@barcos.co`

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "some comment here".
```

- Then you will be asked for the filename/location of the RSA Key. You could just hit enter in order to leave the default name and location `id_rsa`.
- Then you need to set a your own [passphrase](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase) for adding more security to the server. There are many tutorials on Youtube and the whole internet, where adding a passphrase is just ommited or not recommended. **I strongly recommend to set a passphrase in order to set up a secure instance**. By default this command will create a public and a private Key named `id_rsa.pub` and `id_rsa` respectively and they will be saved on the path `~/.ssh/`.

## Step 2 - Add the SSH Key to your Hetzner Cloud Console

In this step is important to clarify that the SSH keys are not shared between Hetzner projects. That means that you need to repeat this step with the same Key or different keys for each new project.

- Select one project or create a new one.
- On left side menu of your project select the `Security` menu.
- Click on the Add SSH Key button.
- Copy the SSH Key from your local machine to the clipboard.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

- Paste the SSH Key on the marked area.
- Add a name for the SSH Key in order to identify it on the Hetzner Cloud Console or let the automatically generated name based on the key comment.
- That's it. this specific SSH Key is ready to be used every time you create a new instance for this specific project.

## Step 3 - Create a Hetzner Intance with the added SSH Key on the Cloud Console

- On left side menu of the project where you added the SSH Key in previous step select the `Servers` menu.
- Click on the `Add Server` button.
- Select a `Location`, an `Ubuntu:20.04 Image`, a `Standard Local (NVMe SSD) Storage Type`, an `Instance Type` and other desired configurations.
- On the `SSH Key` field make sure you click the suggested SSH Key that you added on the previous step. The key field should get highlighted.
- Create the Instance by clicking `CREATE & BUY NOW`.

## Step 4 - Test the login with the SSH Key from your local computer

- Copy the IP address of the Hetzner Instance.
- On your local computer start the login. Replace the xxx.xxx.xxx with the IP address of the created Hetzner Instance.

```bash
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx
```

- Type `yes` in order to add the fingerprint to the known_host.
- Enter the passphrase you set for the SSH Key
- And that's it. The process was successful if you see the welcome message of the Ubuntu Hetzner Instance.

## Conclusion

You can now login to your Hetzner Instace with a secure method.
