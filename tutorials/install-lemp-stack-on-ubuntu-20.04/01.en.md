## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install a LEMP Stack (Linux, NGINX, MySQL Database, PHP) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. By the end of this tutorial you will have a fully functional LEMP stack server.

**Prerequisites**

* Have an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server with a sudo user/root access
* Have `nano` or you favorite text editor installed.

## Step 1 - Update the server

Use the following command to update the package repositories to be sure that we will install the latest software version:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Then, use the following command to upgrade the currently installed packages:

```bash
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
```

The `-y` flag automatically confirms the operation, so you don't have to type `Y` to continue.

## Step 2 - Install NGINX

NGINX is the web server we'll be using, we can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

## Step 3 - Install MySQL

Now, we can install MySQL Server. MySQL is the database that we'll be using, we can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

## Step 4 - Secure MySQL

Secure the newly installed MySQL server using the following command:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

MySQL will ask you to validate the password:

```
VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No:
```

You can press `Y`, then press `ENTER`.

Set the password validation policy. There are three levels:

* `0: LOW    Length >= 8`
* `1: MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters`
* `2: STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary file`

Choose the appropriate number, then press `ENTER`. I recommend you choose a strong password (number 2).

Then, set a root password for the MySQL server.

```
Please set the password for root here.

New password:
```

Next, press `Y` and then `ENTER` to continue with the password you provided.

MySQL will ask if you want to remove anonymous users:

```
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :
```

Press `Y`, then `ENTER` to proceed.

Next, MySQL will ask if you want to disallow root login remotely:

```
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :
```

Press `Y`, then `ENTER` to proceed.

Next, MySQL will ask if you want to remove the test database and access to it:

```
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.

Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :
```

Press `Y`, then `ENTER` to proceed.

Now, for the last one, MySQL will ask if you want to reload the privilege tables:

```
Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :
```

Press `Y`, then `ENTER` to proceed.

All done. Now you have a secure MySQL server.

## Step 5 - Install PHP

Unfortunately, Ubuntu 20.04 doesn't have the latest stable PHP version, but there is a PPA (Personal Package Archive) which has the latest stable PHP version.

Before adding the PPA, we need to install a few dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
```

Ok, now we can add the PPA using the following command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php -y
```

All good, now use the following command to install PHP version 8.1:

```bash
sudo apt install php8.1-fpm php8.1-mysql -y
```

Note that you can also change the version, for example: `php8.0` or `php7.4`.

`FPM` is the FastCGI Process Manager which will let us use PHP in NGINX.

`php8.1-mysql` is the extension which allows PHP to interact with the MySQL server.

At this point you're done with installing packages.

## Step 6 - Configure NGINX for PHP

By default, NGINX doesn't handle PHP files, so we need to edit the default configuration file.

Use your favorite text editor to edit the default configuration file, i'll be using `nano`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-sites-available/default
```

In this file, we'll need to scroll down a bit, inside the `server` block, after the `location /` directive, we'll need to add the following:

```nginx
        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;  
        }
```

If you installed another PHP version, you can change it here.

This tells NGINX to pass all files with the `.php` extension to the FastCGI process manager we have installed earlier.

You can also add `index.php` to the list here:

```
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html index.php;
```

Save the file, then exit. **(CTRL+X+Y, ENTER)** for nano.

Run the following command to check if the NGINX configuration is OK:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

You should see something like this:

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Next, restart NGINX using the following command:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

## Step 7 - Check if PHP is working

Now, let's check if PHP is working with NGINX. We can create a simple "Hello, World" PHP script.

The default root directory for NGINX is `/var/www/html`.

Let's create a `hello.php` file in that directory:

```
sudo nano /var/www/html/hello.php
```

Inside the file, add the following content:

```php
<?php

echo 'Hello, World!';
```

Save the file, then exit. **(CTRL+X+Y, ENTER)** for nano.

Now, we can access in our browser `http://<serverIP>/hello.php`.

To get your server's public IP Address, use the following command:

```bash
hostname -I
```

If that doesn't work, try using `cURL` to get get server's public IP Address:

```bash
curl ipv4.icanhazip.com
```

You should see this:

![PHP Hello World](images/php-hello-world.png)

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed a LEMP Stack on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You can start deploying your LEMP Stack applications. Good Luck!
