## Installing PrestaShop

### Step 1 - Preparing for installation

**1.1 Create database on konsoleH**

* Log onto [konsoleH](https://konsoleh.hetzner.com/).
* Navigate to `Services` -> `Databases` -> `MariaDB/MySQL ».
* Go to `MariaDB/MySQL Databases` and click on `Add`.
  ![](images/konsoleHAddDatabase.png)
* If you want, you can now customize the name of the `database`, the `login`, and the `password`.
  ![](images/konsoleHDatabaseSetup.png)
* Click on `Save`. The `Connection ID` should now be displayed above the database access data.
* Now copy these into a text file on your computer, for example. You will need them later for the setup.

**1.2 PHP settings on konsoleH**

* On konsoleH, navigate to `Services` -> `Settings` -> `PHP Configuration ».`
  ![](images/konsoleHPHPConfiguration.png)
* Go to `PHP-Version` and select the latest PHP version. PrestaShop needs to be `PHP 7.2` or newer.
* Click on `Save`.
* On the same page, navigate to the `PHP settings` and verify that `allow_url_fopen` is set to `on` and the `memory_limit` minimum to `256M`.
* If there is a lower value there, select `256` in the field to the right and click on `save` at the bottom left of the page.

**1.3 Generate SSH key**

* Generate an SSH key pair with the following specifications [https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/account-management/access-details/login-data#additional-ftp-users](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/account-management/access-details/login-data#additional-ftp-users) and [https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-ssh-key).
* On konsoleH, navigate to `Services` -> `Access Details` -> `Login data »`.
  ![](images/konsoleHLogindetails.png)

**Install your public key via an FTP client:**

* Upload your public key `id_<type>.pub` there under `Public SSH Keys` by clicking on `Add`. Then copy the content into the window that you see after that.
* Then click on `Add`. Your public key and a comment should now appear under `Public SSH Keys` -> `Key Type`.

### Step 2 - Upload PrestaShop to the web directory

* **Option 1 - Via an SSH connection**

  * Download the latest version of PrestaShop from the official website: [https://prestashop.com/prestashop-offers/classic/](https://prestashop.com/prestashop-offers/classic/).
* On Linux, you can unzip the ZIP file using `unzip` in your terminal or by double-clicking it in your file manager.
* On Windows/macOS, you can unzip the ZIP file by double-clicking it in your file manager.
* Now open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the PrestaShop archive:

  ```bash
  cd /pathToPrestashop/
  ```

* On konsoleH, navigate to `Settings` -> `Access Details` -> `Login data` and copy the SSH connection command by clicking on the red page icon.
* Upload the required files to the web hosting server by pasting the copied command and adjust it as follows:

  ```bash
  scp index.php prestashop.zip testuser@wwwxyz.your-server.de:public_html/ -p 222
  ```

* You may need to refer to your previously created private SSH key here. To do this, simply add the following line to your SCP command:

  ```bash
  -i <PathToYourSSH-Key/id_<type>
* Now you can continue with the installation of PrestaShop as described in step 3.
  
* **Option 2 - Via a FTP client**

* Download the latest version of PrestaShop from the official website: [https://prestashop.com/prestashop-offers/classic/](https://prestashop.com/prestashop-offers/classic/).
* On Linux, you can unzip the ZIP file using `unzip` in your terminal or by double-clicking it in your file manager.
* On Windows/macOS, you can unzip the ZIP file by double-clicking it in your file manager.
* Now open your FTP client. We used `FileZilla` for the installation.
* Click on `File` -> `Site Manager` -> `New site` and name the server, for example: `PrestashopTest`.
  ![](images/FileZillaSiteManager.png)
* Go to `Protocol` and select `SFTP-SSH File Transfer Protocol`. Go to `Host` and enter your web hosting server `wwwxyz.your-server.de`. Then go to `Port` and enter `22`.
* Go to `Logon Type`, and select `Key file`. Go to `User` and enter your login name from konsoleH.
* Go to `Key file` and click on `Browse`.
* In the now-open window, navigate to the directory where you saved your SSH key pair.
* Now select your private key:

  ```bash
  id_<type>
  ```

* Add it to `Filezilla` by double-clicking it, and connect to the web directory on the web hosting server by clicking on `connect`.
* In `FileZilla`, navigate to the directory on the left where you extracted the downloaded file and to your `public_html` directory on the right.
* Now drag the two files `index.php` & `prestashop.zip` from the left window to the right window and wait until FileZilla has completed the transfer.

### Step 3 - PrestaShop Installation Wizard

* In your browser, navigate to the domain address where you uploaded the PrestaShop files `https://example.de/`.
  ![](images/PrestashopInstaller.png)
* Now wait a moment until the installation wizard has unpacked the archive.
* You should now be on the installer's welcome page. You can select the language under `Continue the Installation in:`
  ![](images/PrestashopLanguage.png)
* Click on `Next` and you will be taken to the license agreement. Check the box `I agree to the above terms and conditions`.
  ![](images/PrestashopT+C.png)
* On the following page, enter your website name, your login details for the web interface, and your time zone.
  ![](images/PrestashopConfiguration.png)
* By clicking on `Next`, you will be taken to the pre-configuration of your PrestaShop.
  ![](images/PrestashopContent.png)
* By clicking `Next`, you will be taken to the setup for the database. Here, you need to fill in the data from konsoleH:
  ![](images/PrestashopDatabase.png)
* Click on `Test you databse connection now` to check that the data is correct and that a connection to the database can be established. Below this, you should now see a green field with a green check mark and the text `Database connected`.
* Click on `Next` to complete the PrestaShop setup. The wizard will now create the necessary tables in the database, install all the required modules and plugins, and make the final configurations.
* You should now be on the last page of the wizard, where you will be informed that you must delete the `Install` folder.
  ![](images/PrestashopInstallFolder.png)
* The easiest way to do this is via the FTP client as follows:
  * Select the `Install` folder by right-clicking on it and then click on `Delete`.
  ![](images/PrestashopFileZillaInstallOrdnerLöschen.png)
* This works as follows via `SSH`. Please note, however, that you should only execute this command in the PrestaShop installation directory. Make sure you copy it correctly; otherwise, you may delete other directories with the same name or your entire web directory. Warning: We accept no liability for deleted data.
  * Navigate to the installation directory of PrestaShop:

    ```bash
    cd <PathToInstallationDirectory/>
    ```

  * Delete the PrestaShop `Install` folder:

  ```bash
  rm -fr Install/
  ```

* You should now be done with the installation and setup of PrestaShop and should be able to log in to the administration interface of your online store.
