## Introduction

PocketBase is a powerful and flexible backend solution that offers real-time data synchronization, built-in authentication, and a robust API, making it an excellent choice for various applications. This tutorial provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you navigate through the deployment process. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to deploy a reliable and scalable PocketBase instance for your application.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A Hetzner Account: [Sign up](https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp) at Hetzner.
* Basic Knowledge of Linux Command Line.

## Step 1 - Deploy a New Server

Log in to the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud).

Create a new project if needed.

Click on "Add Server" and choose the server type (CX22 or higher recommended).

**Note**: If you are comfortable with using ARM64 architecture, you can choose ARM64 instances to get better performance for the same price compared to traditional x86 instances.

Choose a data center location.

Select the image (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is highly recommended).

Configure server specs and SSH keys.

Click "Create & Buy Now".

## Step 2 - Connect to Your Server

Use an SSH client (PuTTY or Terminal) to connect:

```console
ssh root@<your_server_ip>
```

## Step 3 - Prepare Your Server

Start by updating your server with the following commands:

```console
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install -y unzip
```

Next, create a user for PocketBase with this command:

```console
adduser pocketbase
```

You'll be prompted to enter a secure [password](https://www.random.org/passwords). Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

Now, switch to the new user by running:

```console
su - pocketbase
```

## Step 4 - Download PocketBase

Visit the [PocketBase releases page](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases) and select the latest release. Choose the appropriate build for your instance - either linux_amd64 or linux_arm64. Copy the download URL, and use wget to download the file.

```console
wget <url>
```

To unzip the downloaded archive, use the following command:

```console
unzip <filename>
```

**Tip**: If you need to check the filename, you can list the files in the directory with:

```console
ls
```

## Step 5 - Configure and Create a Service

First, switch back to the root user by running:

```console
exit
```

To enable the binary to bind to ports below 1024, use the following command:

```console
setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /home/pocketbase/pocketbase
```

To create a systemd service, use the following command:

```console
bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/pocketbase.service
[Unit]
Description=PocketBase
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=pocketbase
WorkingDirectory=/home/pocketbase
ExecStart=/home/pocketbase/pocketbase serve --http=0.0.0.0:80
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable pocketbase.service
systemctl restart pocketbase.service'
```

## Step 6 - Set Up an Admin Account

Open `<your_server_ip>/_` in your browser, and you will see the following screen:

![set-up-an-admin-account](images/set-up-an-admin-account.png)

Enter your email and [password](https://www.random.org/passwords) in the respective fields.

Then, click **Create and Login**.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and configured PocketBase on your server.
