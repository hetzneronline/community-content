## Introduction

PocketBase is a powerful and flexible backend solution that offers real-time data synchronization, built-in authentication, and a robust API, making it an excellent choice for various applications. This tutorial provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you navigate through the deployment process. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to deploy a reliable and scalable PocketBase instance for your application.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* 1 server with Ubuntu 24.04
  * You can use an Arm64 instance to get better performance compared to traditional x86 instances.
  * Root access
* Basic Knowledge of Linux Command Line.

## Step 1 - Prepare Your Server

Use an SSH client (PuTTY or Terminal) to connect to your server:

```bash
ssh root@<your_server_ip>
```

Start by updating your server with the following commands:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt install -y unzip
```

Next, create a user for PocketBase with this command:

```bash
adduser pocketbase
```

You'll be prompted to enter a secure [password](https://www.random.org/passwords). Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

Now, switch to the new user by running:

```bash
su - pocketbase
```

## Step 2 - Download PocketBase

Visit the [PocketBase releases page](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases) and select the latest release. Choose the appropriate build for your instance â€” either `linux_amd64` or `linux_arm64`. Copy the download URL, and use wget to download the file.

> Run this command to check if you have an amd64 instance or an arm64 instance.<br>
> `[[ "$(uname -m)" == "x86_64" ]] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64"`

```bash
wget <url>
```

To unzip the downloaded archive, use the following command:

```bash
unzip <filename>
```

**Tip**: If you need to check the filename, you can list the files in the directory with:

```bash
ls
```

## Step 3 - Configure and Create a Service

First, switch back to the root user by running:

```bash
exit
```

To enable the binary to bind to ports below 1024, use the following command:

```bash
setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /home/pocketbase/pocketbase
```

To create a systemd service, use the following command:

```bash
bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/pocketbase.service
[Unit]
Description=PocketBase
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=pocketbase
WorkingDirectory=/home/pocketbase
ExecStart=/home/pocketbase/pocketbase serve --http=0.0.0.0:80
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable pocketbase.service
systemctl restart pocketbase.service'
```

## Step 4 - Set Up an Admin Account

Open PocketBase in your browser:

```http
http://<your_server_ip>/_
``` 
> Example: `http://203.0.113.1/_`

You will see the following screen:

![set-up-an-admin-account](images/set-up-an-admin-account.png)

Enter an email and a [password](https://www.random.org/passwords) in the respective fields. Make sure you remember the login credentials for future logins.

Then, click **Create and Login**.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and configured PocketBase on your server.
