## Introduction

If you're the only one who needs to SSH into your server, there is a simple way to avoid exposing the SSH server to the internet: First, block traffic incoming to the SSH port by default with a Hetzner firewall. Second, connect via SSH with a simple shell script that executes the following steps:

1. Determine the public IP address of the client.
2. Add a firewall rule via the Hetzner API that allows incoming traffic to the SSH port from the address from step 1.
3. Connect to the server.
4. Reset the firewall rules changed in step 2.

In this tutorial, I will describe this approach in detail. It has some limitations, which I'll discuss below. In particular, it doesn't work well when you need to connect to your server from different client IP addresses at the same time.

**Prerequisites**

For this tutorial, you'll need:
- A Hetzner Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) in the [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/),
- a running [Hetzner server](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/getting-started/creating-a-server),
- a *nix client (Linux, macOS or similar) from which you connect to the server,
- the command-line JSON processor [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed on the client.

## Step 0: Block incoming SSH traffic by default

Create a firewall and apply it to your server. This step is straight forward and explained in [the official Hetzner docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/firewalls/getting-started/creating-a-firewall).

If you create a new firewall in the console, it has by default a rule that allows incoming traffic to port 22 from every IP address. Make sure to delete this rule. For the purposes of this tutorial, you don't need any rules at all; in other words: all incoming traffic can be blocked by default.

In the following steps, I will assume that the name of your firewall is `block-ssh-firewall`.

The interesting part is how to connect once the firewall is in place. I will now explain the necessary shell commands step by step so that you can follow just by typing them in your terminal. Shell commands are always preceded by `$`. In the end, I will combine these commands in a single shell script.

## Step 1: Determine the client's public IP address

There are several ways to get your own public IP address. One is to query one of Google's DNS servers `ns[1-4].google.com`. If you request from them TXT records for the domain `o-o.myaddr.l.google.com`, they will respond with your IP address. On *nix systems, you can send DNS requests with `dig`:

```bash
$ dig @ns1.google.com -4 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short
```

The output of the command should be something like:
```
"203.0.113.1"
```

The flag `-4` means that `dig` uses IPv4 to connect to the DNS server. If you want to use SSH with IPv6, you'll need your IPv6 address and therefore should force `dig` to use IPv6 with the `-6` option:

```bash
$ dig @ns1.google.com -6 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short
```

Now you should see an IPv6 address, for example:
```
"2001:db8:5678::1"
```

We need the address without quotes, so we delete them with `tr`:

```bash
$ dig @ns1.google.com -6 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d '"'
```

Output:
```
2001:db8:5678::1
```

Now let's save the IP addresses in shell variables so we can use them in later steps:
```bash
$ my_ipv4=$(dig @ns1.google.com -4 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d '"')
$ my_ipv6=$(dig @ns1.google.com -6 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d '"')
```

## Step 2: Allow incoming SSH connections from the client

As explained in the [docs](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#firewall-actions-set-rules), the rules for the firewall with ID `1234` can be set by sending a `POST` request to `https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls/1234/actions/set_rules`. But it is not possible to *add* one rule directly with via the API - existing rules will always be overwritten. That's why we need to get the existing rules first. While doing this, we can also determine the firewall ID given its name.

For the following steps, save your API token in a variable:
```bash
$ API_TOKEN="your token"
```

### Step 2.1: Retrieve information about the firewall

We send a `GET` request to retrieve information about all firewalls with the name `block-ssh-firewall` (see [docs](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#firewalls-get-all-firewalls)):

```bash
$ curl \
    --silent \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls?name=block-ssh-firewall"
```

The output should look like this:
````json
{
  "firewalls": [
    {
      "id": 12345678,
      "name": "block-ssh-firewall",
      "labels": {},
      "created": "2024-08-01T14:49:03+00:00",
      "rules": [
        {
          "direction": "in",
          "protocol": "icmp",
          "port": null,
          "source_ips": [
            "0.0.0.0/0",
            "::/0"
          ],
          "destination_ips": [],
          "description": null
        }
      ],
      "applied_to": [
        {
          "type": "server",
          "server": {
            "id": 87654321
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 25,
      "previous_page": null,
      "next_page": null,
      "last_page": 1,
      "total_entries": 1
    }
  }
}
````
As I said before, your firewall does not necessarily have any rules. But to make it more interesting, I added a rule that allows incoming ICMP traffic. We obviously don't want to override this rule, so we must include it in our call to the `set_rules` endpoint.

We need therefore two pieces of information from the JSON response: the value of `id` and the value of `rules`. Those values can be extracted with the command-line JSON parser `jq`.

First, save the output of the `GET` request in a variable:

````bash
$ firewalls=$(curl \
    --silent \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls?name=block-ssh-firewall")
````

Since we query by name and firewall names must be unique, we can assume that the `firewalls` array in the response has exactly one element. We can extract this element with:

```bash
$ echo $firewalls | jq '.firewalls | first'
```

Now we can extract the values of the keys we are interested in by adding them to the `jq` filter:

```bash
$ firewall_id=$(echo $firewalls | jq '.firewalls | first .id')
$ original_rules=$(echo $firewalls | jq '.firewalls | first .rules')
```

### Step 2.2: Add a rule that allows SSH connections from the client

The rule that allows incoming SSH traffic from the IP addresses `203.0.113.1` and `2001:db8:5678::1` is represented by the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "direction": "in",
  "port": "22",
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "source_ips": ["203.0.113.1/32", "2001:db8:5678::1/128"]
}
```

As you can see from the [documentation](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#firewall-actions-set-rules), the endpoint expects that `source_ips` contains blocks of IP addresses in CIDR notation. The suffix `/32` means that 32 bits of the address before the suffix are fixed, `/128` means that 128 bits of the address are fixed. Since IPv4 addresses have 32 bits and IPv6 addresses have 128 bits, our `source_ips` array contains two CIDR blocks with exactly one address, respectively.

Using the shell variables `$my_ipv4` and `$my_ipv6` from step 1, we can save this object in another variable:
```bash
$ allow_ssh_rule=$(cat << END
      {
      "direction": "in",
      "port": "22",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "source_ips": ["$my_ipv4/32",   "$my_ipv6/128"]
    }
  END
  )
```

This rule must be added to the array `$original_rules`. We use `jq` to do this. In its [filter language](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/#basic-filters), the `+` operator can be used to concatenate arrays:
```bash
$ new_rules=$(echo $original_rules | jq ". = . + [$allow_ssh_rule]")
```

Now we update the rules by calling the `set_rules` endpoint:
```bash
$ curl \
    -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"rules\":$new_rules}" \
    "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls/$firewall_id/actions/set_rules"
```

You can verify in the Hetzner console that the firewall has a new rule that allows incoming traffic from your IP address to port 22.

## Step 3: Connect to the server

Nothing special here, simply call SSH like you normally would. For example:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_host holu@your_host
```

## Step 4: Reset the firewall rules

We can reset the firewall rules with a second call to the `set_rules` endpoint. We saved the original rules in the shell variable `$original_rules`, which we use now:

```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"rules\":$original_rules}" \
  "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls/$firewall_id/actions/set_rules"
```

## Step 5: Combine previous steps into a shell script

Below, I combined the previous steps together with a few improvements in a single shell script.

Maybe you want to use not only `ssh` to connect to your instance but also other programs like `scp`, `ansible`, `capistrano` etc. That's why I think it makes sense to pass the command itself as argument to the script. The same goes for the name of the firewall. If you save the script as `ssh-hetzner.sh` you can run it like this:
```bash
ssh-hetzner.sh block-ssh-firewall ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_host holu@your_host
```

You must set the `API_TOKEN` environment variable before calling the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function usage() {
    echo "\
Usage: $0 <firewall name> <command>
Example:
  $0 block-ssh-firewall ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_host holu@your_host\
" 1>&2
  exit 1
}

function handle_api_error() {
  if [ "$(echo "$1" | jq .error)" != "null" ]
  then
    echo $1 1>&2
    exit 2
  fi
}

if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
  usage
fi

# Exit on error.
set -e

# Determine my public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
my_ipv4=$(dig @ns1.google.com -4 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d '"')
my_ipv6=$(dig @ns1.google.com -6 o-o.myaddr.l.google.com TXT +short | tr -d '"')

# Get the ID and the current rules of the passed firewall.
response=$(curl \
  --silent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls?name=$1")
handle_api_error "$response"

firewall_id=$(echo $response | jq ".firewalls.[0].id")
original_rules=$(echo $response | jq ".firewalls.[0].rules")

# Add to the current rules a new rule that allows incoming SSH traffic from my IP addresses.
allow_ssh_rule=$(cat << END
  {
    "direction": "in",
    "port": "22",
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "source_ips": ["$my_ipv4/32", "$my_ipv6/128"]
  }
END
)
new_rules=$(echo $original_rules | jq ". = . + [$allow_ssh_rule]")

# Make the firewall adopt the new ruleset.
response=$(curl \
  --silent \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"rules\":$new_rules}" \
  "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls/$firewall_id/actions/set_rules")
handle_api_error "$response"

# Reset ruleset when the script exits (even upon receiving a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal).
function cleanup() {
  response=$(curl \
    --silent \
    -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"rules\":$original_rules}" \
    "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/firewalls/$firewall_id/actions/set_rules")
  handle_api_error "$response"
}
trap "cleanup" EXIT

# Remove first argument, which is the firewall name.
shift

# Execute the other arguments as shell command.
$@
```

## Limitations

### Multiple connections at the same time

You can't run the script above twice at the same time. If, for example, you want to run ansible while another SSH session is open, you should *not* run
```bash
$ ssh-hetzner.sh block-ssh-firewall ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_host holu@your_host
````
and then, in another terminal:
```bash
$ ssh-hetzner.sh block-ssh-firewall ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
If you do this, the API will complain that you try to add the same rule twice to the firewall.

Instead, you may allow SSH traffic until you press Enter with this command:
```bash
$ hetzner_ssh.sh block-ssh-firewall read key
```
Now you can `ssh` and `ansible` as usual:
```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_host holu@your_host
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

### Connections from different clients at the same time

You should not follow the described approach if there is a chance that you and some other client with a different IP address need SSH access at the same time. If this happens, you may leave the SSH port open for one of your IP addresses indefinitely:

1. Client A connects to the server. Now SSH traffic from IP address a is allowed.
2. Client B connects to the server. Now SSH traffic from IP addresses a and b are allowed.
3. Client A closes the connection. Now no SSH traffic is allowed.
4. Client B closes the connection. *Now SSH traffic from IP address a is allowed.*
