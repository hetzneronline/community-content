## Introduction

[Open Game Panel(OGP)](https://opengamepanel.org) is free, popular easy to use open source gameserver management panel for both linux as well as windows based servers.
OGP consists of 2 part:
* **Panel**:  Web Panel is the Interface by which we will be able to manage various agents and gameservers. A single Panel can have multiple Agents.
* **Agent**:  Agent is where gameserver will run, & remotely managed by Panel.

*A single server can host both Panel and Agent, but it is recommended to not run Agent on the server where Panel is installed*

In this tutorial we will be installing Web Panel of OGP.

**Prerequisites**

Before we proceed we are assuming that:
* You have either a Fresh installation of Cloud VPS or a Dedicated Server.
* Your Server must have either Debian (9 or 10) or Ubuntu (18.04 or 16.04) installed.


## Step 1 - Install & Setup of LAMP Server

In this step we will be installing PHP, Apache2, MySQL, Git and extras, which are required to run the panel.

**Note:** If you are using Debian 10 or low make sure you have sudo installed if not then go ahead and install sudo using `apt-get install sudo` using your root account.

After this add your user to sudoer if not already using:
```
usermod -aG sudo "{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LINUX_USERNAME}"
```

### Step 1.1
**For all Distributions**
```
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

### Step 1.2
**For Ubuntu 16.04**
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 curl subversion php7.0 php7.0-gd php7.0-zip libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-mysql php7.0-xmlrpc php-pear mysql-server php7.0-mbstring php-gettext git php-bcmath
```

**For Ubuntu 18.04**
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 curl subversion php7.2 php7.2-gd php7.2-zip libapache2-mod-php7.2 php7.2-curl php7.2-mysql php7.2-xmlrpc php-pear mysql-server php7.2-mbstring php-gettext git php-bcmath
```

**For Debian 10**
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 curl subversion php7.3 php7.3-gd php7.3-zip libapache2-mod-php7.3 php7.3-curl php7.3-mysql php7.3-xmlrpc php-pear mariadb-server php7.3-mbstring php-gettext git php-bcmath
```

**For Debian 9**
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 curl subversion php7.0 php7.0-gd php7.0-zip libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-mysql php7.0-xmlrpc php-pear mysql-server php7.0-mbstring php-gettext git php-bcmath
```
*Note: During the MySQL server installation, if you are prompted to provide a root user password. Please choose something secure and write it down, as the installer will ask you for it to create the initial OGP database later.*

### Step 1.3
Secure your Database installation and setup root password using the follow command. 

*This setup is not necessary if you are already prompted to setup MySQL root password in previous setup. (for older version of Ubuntu/Debian)*
```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
*Note: During this process, you will be asked to set a root user password. Please choose something secure and write it down, as the installer will ask you for it to create the initial OGP database later.*

## Step 2 - Download and Install OGP Panel

Now we will download the Panel Easy-Installer of OGP and run it.

### Step 2.1
```
wget "https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/Easy-Installers/raw/master/Linux/Debian-Ubuntu/ogp-panel-latest.deb"
sudo dpkg -i "ogp-panel-latest.deb"
```
This will prompt you to Enter your MySQL root password. Please go ahead and enter your secure MySQL root password.

Once this is done, It will create a database and display some information as show below. Note down these information as we will need this in next steps:
```
MySQL Host: localhost
MySQL User: ogpuser
MySQL User Password: QmSCw9TE3UcL
MySQL Database Name: ogp_panel
```

### Step 2.2
Now open the browser and go to `http://<10.0.0.1>/index.php`
It will perform some check to verify if system is compitable. You need to scroll down and click on "Next".

It will display a form asking for MySQL database information. Go ahead and enter the details we got at the end of Step 2.1 and click "Next".

Now it will display a form to create Admin user. Enter details as per your liking and click "Next".

### Step 2.3
Finally it ask to delete `install.php` and change ownership of `includes/config.inc.php` to 644 for security purpose which we will do next.

Open your SSH and run:
```
rm /var/www/html/install.php
chmod 644 /var/www/html/includes/config.inc.php
```
Congrats! Open Game Panel is now installed on your Server. You can open your browser and login using `http://<10.0.0.1>/index.php`

## Step 3 - Installing a Theme (Optional)

Lets be honest, Open Game Panel default theme in quite boring. You can install some theme from searching on Internet for OGP Themes.

Here we will be installing a very cool theme called [Obsidian](https://github.com/hmrserver/Obsidian) created by HMR.

### Step 3.1
Open your SSH and run:
```
cd /var/www/html/themes/
clone https://github.com/hmrserver/Obsidian.git
mv Obsidian/themes/Obsidian/* Obsidian/
rm -r Obsidian/themes
```

### Step 3.2
Now go to your OGP Panel and Navigate to Administration > Theme Settings, Change the theme to "Obsidian" and save it.

Now your have a awsome theme for your Panel. Enjoy!

## Conclusion

Your OGP Panel is now ready to be used for controlling hundred different type of support gameservers. You can add Agents to your Panel from Administration->Servers section.

If you wanna learn about installing of Agent and running of various gameservers follow along with next tutorial.
