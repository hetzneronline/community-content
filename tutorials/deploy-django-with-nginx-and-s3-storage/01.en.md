## Introduction

Django is a powerful Python web framework designed for building robust web applications. This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying a Django project in a production environment using industry best practices.

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up a production-ready Django environment
- Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Integrating S3-compatible storage for media files
- Securing your deployment with proper configurations

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Basic Linux command knowledge
- A Debian-based server with root/sudo access
- An S3-compatible storage bucket ([Hetzner Object Storage](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/), or [MinIO](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/how-to-install-minio-on-debian))
- A domain name (optional but recommended)
- System requirements:
  - Minimum 1GB RAM
  - 10GB storage space
  - Python 3.8 or higher

## Step 1 - System Preparation

First, let's update your system and install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv nginx
```

## Step 2 - Django Project Setup

Let's create a clean development environment:

```shell
# Create and navigate to project directory
mkdir /home/<yourname>/django_project
cd /home/<yourname>/django_project

# Set up Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install core dependencies
pip install django python-dotenv

# Create Django project
django-admin startproject myproject .

# Initialize database
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Step 3 - Configure Django for S3 Storage

1. Install `django-storages` and `boto3`:

   These libraries allow Django to interact with S3-compatible storage:

   ```shell
   pip install django-storages boto3
   ```

2. Modify `settings.py`:

   Open `myproject/settings.py` and add the following configurations:

   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   # Load environment variables from the .env file
   load_dotenv()

   # Add 'storages' to the INSTALLED_APPS list
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # Other installed apps
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'storages',
   ]

   # Basic security and configuration settings
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]
   DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"

   # Static and media file settings
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]
   STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "assets"
   STATIC_URL = "assets/"
   MEDIA_URL = "media/"

   # S3 configuration
   AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv("AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
   AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
   AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL = os.getenv("AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL")
   AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv("AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME")
   AWS_S3_FILE_OVERWRITE = False
   AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = "private"  # Restrict file access
   AWS_S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION = "s3"

   # Storage settings for Django
   STORAGES = {
       "default": {
           "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",  # Use S3 for default file storage
       },
       "staticfiles": {
           "BACKEND": "django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage",  # Default storage for static files
       },
   }
   ```

   Apply the Changes

   ```shell
   # Create a directory for static files
   mkdir static
   # Collect static files
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

3. Create a `.env` File for AWS Credentials:

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your AWS credentials:

   ```ini
   AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=your_endpoint_url
   AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   ```

## Step 4 - Set Up Gunicorn as a WSGI Server

1. Install and Configure Gunicorn

   Gunicorn will serve our Django application:

   ```shell
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

   Test Gunicorn:

   ```shell
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi
   ```

   Press `CTRL + C` to stop it.

2. Create a Systemd Service for Gunicorn:

   Create a service file:

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
   ```

   Add the following content:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Gunicorn daemon for Django project
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=www-data
   Group=www-data
   WorkingDirectory=/home/<yourname>/django_project
   ExecStart=/home/<yourname>/django_project/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 myproject.wsgi:application

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Enable and start Gunicorn:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
   sudo systemctl start gunicorn
   ```

   Check to see if the Gunicorn Service is Active:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl status gunicorn
   ```

## Step 5 - Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

1. Create an Nginx Configuration File

   Create a new Nginx configuration file:

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;
       server_name <your_server_ip_or_domain>;

       access_log /var/log/nginx/django_access.log;
       error_log /var/log/nginx/django_error.log;

       client_max_body_size 100M;  # Adjust based on your needs

       location / {
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
       }

       # Serve static files directly through nginx
       location /assets/ {
           alias /home/<yourname>/django_project/assets/;
           expires 30d;
           add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
       }
   }
   ```

2. Enable the Configuration and Restart Nginx

   ```shell
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

## Step 6 - Secure Your Setup with Firewall and SSL (Optional)

Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```shell
# Install and configure UFW
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow "Nginx Full"
sudo ufw enable
```

If you have a domain, secure it with Let's Encrypt SSL:

```shell
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

## Step 7 - File Upload Testing

Let's create a simple app to test our S3 storage integration:

```shell
python manage.py startapp upload
```

Add the following model to test file uploads:

```python
from django.db import models

class TestUpload(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, help_text="Enter a name for the upload")
    image = models.FileField(upload_to="uploads/", help_text="Select a file to upload")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Upload: {self.name}"
```

Register the model in your admin interface:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import TestUpload

@admin.register(TestUpload)
class TestUploadAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['name', 'image']
    search_fields = ['name']
```

Apply the database changes:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Step 8 - Deployment Verification

### Testing Your Setup

1. Visit your domain or server IP in a browser
2. Access the admin panel at `/admin`
3. Try uploading a file through the TestUpload model
4. Verify the file appears in your S3 bucket

### Troubleshooting

- If static files aren't loading, run `python manage.py collectstatic`
- If uploads fail, check your S3 credentials and permissions
- For 502 errors, verify Gunicorn is running properly

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a production-ready Django deployment with:

- A robust application server (Gunicorn)
- High-performance reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Scalable cloud storage solution (S3)
- Automated process management (Systemd)
