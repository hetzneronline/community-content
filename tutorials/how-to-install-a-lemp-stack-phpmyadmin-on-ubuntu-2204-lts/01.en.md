## Introduction

In this tutorial I'm going to cover how to install phpMyAdmin with Nginx on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. Additionally, I'm going to setup a simple website and create the configuration within `Nginx` to make the website available.

**Prerequisites**

* LEMP stack already installed, e.g. "[How to install a LEMP Stack on Ubuntu](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-20.04)"
* A domain name (e.g. `example.com`) with an `A` DNS record, and optionaly an `AAAA` DNS record, pointing to your server.

**Example terminology**

* Username: root
* IPv4: 10.0.0.1
* Domain: example.com

Please replace `root` with an own username, `10.0.0.1` with your own IP address and `example.com` with your own domain in all example commands.

## Step 1 - Login to server

Login to your server using the root user or a user with sudo privileges:

```shell
ssh root@10.0.0.1
```

Make sure your Ubuntu server is fully up to date:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## Step 2 - Install PHP extensions and configure Nginx

<details>

<summary>You should already have PHP and Nginx installed on your server.</summary>

<blockquote>

If you haven't installed the LAMP stack yet, follow the steps 1 to 6 in the tutorial "[How to install a LEMP Stack on Ubuntu](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-20.04)".

* To check which PHP version is installed, you can use `php -version`.
* To verify that Nginx is running, you can enter your server IP address into a web browser. You should see the Nginx default welcome page.

</blockquote>

</details>

In addition, you should install the following PHP extensions:

```shell
sudo apt install php8.2 php8.2-mbstring php8.2-xml php8.2-curl
```

<u>Configure Nginx to use PHP processor</u>

- First, backup the default configuration:
  
  ```shell
  sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.bak
  ```

- Open the default configuration file:
  
  ```shell
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  ```

- Make sure  the `server` block includes the `location /` directives below. If they're missing, add them now:
  
  ```shell
          location ~ \.php$ {
                  include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                  fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
          }

          location /phpmyadmin {
                  index index.php;
          }
  ```

  Save and exit the editor (`CTRL`+`X`, `Y`, Enter), then check the configuration for syntax errors:
  
  ```shell
  sudo nginx -t
  ```

- If there aren't any problems, restart Nginx to apply the changes:
  
  ```shell
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

## Step 3 - Install phpMyAdmin

To manage your databases through a web interface, install phpMyAdmin:

```shell
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```

During the installation process, you will be prompted to:

* **Choose a web server**  
  You can choose between `Apache` and `Lighttpd`. You have `Nginx`, so you shouldn't select any of them. Press TAB and select `<OK>` to continue without selecting anything.
* **Choose if you want `dbconfig-common` to configure a database**  
  Select `<YES>`.

<blockquote>

If you installed the LEMP stack with the tutorial linked in the "Prerequisites" section at the top, you might get an error because the MySQL "Validate Password" plugin is enabled. Follow those steps to fix the error:

* Next step for database installation:  
  * Select `<OK>`, then select `abort`
* Remove the plugin
  ```shell
  sudo mysql
  UNINSTALL COMPONENT "file://component_validate_password";
  exit
  ```
* Install phpMyAdmin
  ```shell
  sudo apt install phpmyadmin
  ```
* Add the plugin again
  ```shell
  sudo mysql
  INSTALL COMPONENT "file://component_validate_password";
  exit
  ```

</blockquote>

</details>

Next, create a symbolic link from the phpMyAdmin directory to your Nginx document root directory:

```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html
```

Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

You should now be able to access the phpMyAdmin web interface by visiting your server's domain name or public IP address followed by `/phpmyadmin`, e.g. `example.com/phpmyadmin`.

## Step 4 - Finalizing PHP configuration

To finish, you'll want to adjust some PHP settings. Open the PHP configuration file for editing:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini
```

Find and modify the following lines to increase PHP's file upload limits:

> To find the lines, you can use `CTRL`+`W` and enter a search word

```shell
upload_max_filesize = 32M
post_max_size = 48M
```

Next, you'll want to adjust the max execution time, which determines how long a script is allowed to run before it's terminated:

```shell
max_execution_time = 600
```

Once you've made these changes, save and close the file. Then, restart the PHP service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
```

That's it! You should now have a fully functional LEMP stack with PHP 8.2 and phpMyAdmin installed.

Please note that this is a basic setup guide. In a production environment, you would also need to consider configuring a firewall, setting up SSL, regular backups, etc.
