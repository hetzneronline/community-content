## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through automatically shutting down your Hetzner VPS once its monthly bandwidth crosses a specified limit (e.g., 19 TB). This is useful to avoid overage charges and maintain control over your server usage.

By following this guide, you'll install a Python-based monitoring script, configure your Hetzner Cloud API, and set up a cron job that runs every 30 minutes to check and shut down your VPS when needed.

**Prerequisites**

* [Hetzner Console API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token)
* [SSH access to your VPS](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/add-ssh-key-to-your-hetzner-cloud)
* Basic knowledge of cron jobs and Python. (Don't worry, it's easy! I'll walk you through it.)

## Step 1 - Get Your Hetzner API Key and Server ID

1. Go to the [Hetzner Console](https://console.hetzner.com/).
2. Create an [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) from the project settings.
3. Your `HETZNER_SERVER_ID` is the last part of the URL when you visit your server:
   ```
   https://console.hetzner.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/servers/<SERVER_ID>/overview
   ```
   Save both values securely, you will need them in the script.

## Step 2 - Install the script on the VPS

1. SSH into your Hetzner VPS:
   
   ```bash
   ssh root@<your_host>
   ```

2. Create a `bandwidth_monitor.py` file in your machine with the following content. Replace the `<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>` and `<YOUR_HETZNER_SERVER_ID_HERE>` with the values you saved in step 1:
   
   ```python
   import os
   import urllib.request
   import urllib.error
   import json
   import sys
   from datetime import datetime
   
   API_TOKEN = "<YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE>"
   SERVER_ID = "<YOUR_HETZNER_SERVER_ID_HERE>"
   
   print(f"[{datetime.now()}] Script ran")
   if not API_TOKEN or not SERVER_ID:
       print("Error: HETZNER_API_TOKEN and HETZNER_SERVER_ID must be set.")
       sys.exit(1)
   
   TB = 1024**4
   GB = 1024**3
   SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 19 * TB
   
   
   url = f"https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers/{SERVER_ID}"
   headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
   
   try:
       req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=headers)
       with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
           data = json.loads(response.read().decode('utf-8'))
   except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
       print(f"HTTP Error fetching server data: {e.code} {e.reason}")
       sys.exit(1)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error fetching server data: {e}")
       sys.exit(1)
   
   server = data.get("server", {})
   status = server.get("status", "unknown")
   outgoing_traffic = server.get("outgoing_traffic") or 0
   
   print(f"Current outgoing traffic: {outgoing_traffic / GB:.2f} GB")
   
   if status == "running":
       if outgoing_traffic >= SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES:
           print("19 TB limit reached. Sending shutdown request...")
           try:
               shutdown_req = urllib.request.Request(f"{url}/actions/shutdown", method='POST', headers=headers)
               with urllib.request.urlopen(shutdown_req) as response:
                   print("Shutdown request sent successfully.")
           except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
               print(f"HTTP Error during shutdown: {e.code} {e.reason}")
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Error during shutdown: {e}")
       else:
           print("Server running, but under 19 TB. No action taken.")
   else:
       print(f"Server is not running (status: {status})")
   ```

## Step 3 - Set up a cron job to run the script every 30 minutes

Use the `crontab -e` command in the terminal to open the crontab editor and add the following line to run the script every 30 minutes:

```
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/hetzner-bandwidth-script && /usr/bin/python3 bandwidth_monitor.py >> cron.log 2>&1
```

The path to the script depends on where you saved it. Use `pwd` command to check the current directory. Always use the full path to the script. `cron.log` will log all output from the script. You can view the logs by running `cat cron.log` in the same directory.

## Step 4 - Adjust the Bandwidth Threshold (Optional)

In your Python script (`bandwidth_monitor.py`), the bandwidth threshold is set to `19 TB` by default. You can change this value if you want to trigger the shutdown at a different usage level.

```python
SHUTDOWN_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 19 * TB      # modify this value to your desired threshold
```

## Step 5 - Test the script

Run the script manually to test it:

```python
python3 bandwidth_monitor.py
```

You should see the output in the terminal. If the script detects that the bandwidth has crossed the threshold, it will send a shutdown request to the Hetzner API. Also, check your `cron.log` file to verify that the script ran successfully every 30 minutes.

## Conclusion

You've successfully automated your Hetzner VPS to shut down when the bandwidth threshold is reached. This setup helps prevent unexpected overcharges and allows for better resource management.
